Conceptually, Agile was introduced as an iterative, incremental and adaptive methodology for software development. There are quite a few studies that discuss the success of agile development projects on account of multiple factors like cost, time, quality and productivity. Owing to its popular virtues like enhanced flexibility to incorporate evolving requirements, incremental delivery, quick time to market and ability to keep pace with market trends [1], clients tend to leverage agile methods for a variety of project types in addition to typical small scale development projects. Through this paper, we discuss some of the practical aspects, pros and cons of applying agile principles to different types of IT projects including testing projects, maintenance projects and large-scale development projects.","","978-1-4799-6892-3","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155964","Agile;projects;implementation;large scale development;testing;maintenance","Testing;Maintenance engineering;Software;Planning;Agile software development;Automation;Portals","project management;software development management;software prototyping","agile methodologies;industry projects;agile software development;information technology;agile development projects;agile principles;testing projects;maintenance projects;large-scale development projects","","10","","9","IEEE","16 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of CoPs is one of the practices that agile practitioner literature suggests for knowledge sharing and coordination in large-scale agile software development. Even though CoPs are largely used and studied in other industrial contexts, their usage in industrial large-scale software development has not received much research attention. In this paper we describe our findings from a case study of a large software development organization that successfully used CoPs to support their large-scale agile implementation, as well as their transformation from the waterfall model to Lean and Agile. In this case, the use of CoPs was one of the a key success factors. To advance both research and practice we suggest that future research should pay more attention on CoPs in large-scale agile, e.g. By studying how CoPs should be cultivated in the organization, how they work in practice, what they are used for, as well as the benefits and challenges of cultivating and implementing CoPs.","","978-1-4799-5798-9","10.1109/AGILE.2014.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910401","large-scale agile development;communities of practice;Scrum","Organizations;Communities;Software;Buildings;Context;Software engineering;Agile software development","personnel;software development management;software prototyping","lean development;waterfall model;software development organization;large-scale agile software development;knowledge sharing;CoPs;communities of practice","","","","11","","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the widespread proliferation of agile practices, implementation often fails due to lack of adequate project management support, decreased motivation or fear of increased interaction. Consequently, few organizations effectively adopt agile processes with tailoring often required to integrate agile methodology. This presentation provides an overview of an innovative large-scale tailored implementation of agile development termed the Agile Factory Model (AFM), with the aim of highlighting defect issues of specific importance to organizations undertaking large scale agile development. Drawing upon a substantial internal repository of defects, this study profiles defect severity, cause and lifecycle. Our results indicate that during development and testing the majority of defects which occur in the AFM are of severity 3, with requirements defects making up only 0.7%. Acceptance, Integration and Performance (AIP) testing captures the largest quantity of defects at 26.14% whilst a further 17.28% show up in Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT), where FAT and AIP are sequential stages in the AFM respectively. The results demonstrate that agile practices can be effectively translated to a globally distributed development environment.","","978-1-5090-4147-3","10.1109/IWSM-Mensura.2016.034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809606","Defects;Quality;Agile;Large-scale Agile;Agile Factory Model;Globally Distributed Software Development","Production facilities;Estimation;Planning;Testing;Software measurement;Software;Organizations","life cycle costing;program diagnostics;program testing;project management;software development management;software performance evaluation;software prototyping;software quality","defect analysis;large-scale agile development quality;agile factory model;agile practices;project management support;agile processes;AFM;defect severity;defect cause;defect lifecycle;acceptance-integration-and-performance testing;factory acceptance testing;FAT;AIP testing;globally distributed software development","","2","","","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead of being successful in IT project implementation, the organization has failed in IT project, bad quality software, and running out of budget. The Organization conducted an agile readiness assessment using an agile adoption framework called SAMI (Sidky Agile Measurement Index) to know their agility level. Based on this assessment framework, there is a questionnaire which assesses the process for agile practices adoption in project and organization. Organization involved customer manager, IT manager, IT Section head and IT developers as respondents to fill in the questionnaire related to their experience in IT project. The assessment result mentioned that this organization has passed the criterias to continue the adoption, and agile adoption of project level is at level 3 (Effective), and organizational readiness level is at level 1 (Collaborative). To increase agility level up to maximum level at level 5 (Encompassing), Organization can choose to improve failed assessment items through follow up the recommendation or lower the expectation through reducing the project level into level 1, which is similar level to organization readiness.

In our experiences with off shoring Japanese software development projects to China, we were having difficulties with low quality deliverables and high turnover rate of Chinese members because of social differences. Our attempts to create a common culture were not very successful because people in general are less likely to change their basic views and behavior in a short period of time. We, however, were able to obtain success by acknowledging that differences are going to exist and adopting and adapting agile practices in consideration of the existence of these differences. We will show Kaizen as is used by a Japanese company in software development. We will focus on our experiences with social differences we've found and how we continuously adapted practices in our project to take better advantage of the situation as relationship between members changed. It is based on our over 10 years of experience in trying to improve a software package development at a software company in China, which has now become our subsidiary. During our attempts, we have learned the importance of agile mentality in resolving value difference issues.

However, there is always a challenge for agile teams to decide how much agile sprint time should be spent on hosting agile ceremonies and agile product build tasks. This is due to the fact that if most of the agile sprint time is spent on hosting agile ceremonies then the time for agile product build tasks will be reduced significantly impacting the velocity of the agile team. Hence, there is a need to find a solution with the help of which agile team can strike a right balance among various agile ceremonies and agile product build tasks during a sprint. To overcome this gap, this research paper analyses the data for 14 agile sprints to understand the agile time distribution across agile sprint ceremonies and agile product build tasks under current approach. Because of which, this research paper proposes the values for two newly introduced agile co-efficient namely coefficient of agile ceremony time and co-efficient of agile product build time to suggest the ideal time to be spent on agile ceremonies during a sprint. From the research results, it was evident that the velocity of the agile team following the proposed approach reported an increase in velocity by 13.96% for sprints when compared to the velocity of the agile team following the existing approach. The research work also highlighted that the duration chosen for agile ceremony by agile teams is independent of sprint lengths.","","978-1-6654-1703-7","10.1109/ICRITO51393.2021.9596508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9596508","Agile Methodology;Agile Ceremonies;Sprint Length;Agile Team;Velocity","Agile software development;Market research;Software reliability;Task analysis;Standards;Optimization","project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","agile software development process;standard agile ceremonies;agile team;agile sprint time;agile product build tasks;agile time distribution;agile sprint ceremonies;agile ceremony time;sprint velocity","","","","19","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transitioning to new methods of development is particularly daunting in a large organization that already has a sizeable existing code base and a broad set of existing customers. In our experience, development teams tend to reach a plateau implementing a subset of agile practices, and those tend to be generally focused on the planning and iterative aspects of agile. This paper describes our experience in overcoming the barriers to increasing the adoption of agile practices. Drawing from agile principles, we have developed an approach for improvement that enables teams to accelerate change, deepen their degree of understanding, and increase their success in execution.

In this paper, we propose the use of digital tabletops as a means of collaboration in agile planning meetings for collocated teams. To support this proposal, we introduce Agile Planner for Digital Tabletops, a planning tool that was specifically designed for use on large horizontal displays. A multipart study involving a variety of qualitative methodologies was conducted to evaluate this approach. The study involved 14 individual participants plus a five member agile team. The individual evaluation suggested that in general, the tool is usable with minor issues to be considered in future design revisions. The agile team evaluation revealed a significant interest in the tool and its added benefits to the agility of the planning meeting with some issues to be further enhanced.","","978-0-7695-3321-6","10.1109/Agile.2008.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599452","Agile;planning;collocated;tabletop;meeting","Planning;Usability;Fingers;Handwriting recognition;Speech recognition;Collaboration;Face","groupware;microcomputers;software engineering","digital tabletops;collocated agile planning;agile software development;agile planning;horizontal displays","","11","","27","","15 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the respondents are from software organisations in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, in which most of the companies are located in Malaysia. The clusters of variables resulting from this analysis can serve as a reference to the practitioners planning to adopt the methodology. The top factors identified from this study are shown in terms of (i) developer involvement and organisation-related aspects, (ii) cultural and people related aspects and (iii) customer collaboration and the need for professional skills when using Agile methods. In addition, factor analysis discovered that practitioners disagreed about the importance of the technical aspects of Agile. While we believe that these findings are particularly important from the Malaysian perspective, however, they also help add to the body of evidence in the field of software engineering and software process particularly in terms of Agile methods adoption.

Of equal instructional importance is to what extent the student perceives value in the process used to achieve this goal: is it a support or an impediment? Previous experience with heavy weight processes produced anecdotal evidence that students perceived them as onerous and irrelevant. To determine student perceptions of the relevancy of agile principles, we conducted a year long study during senior student software development projects in which they applied agile principles working with industry clients under minimal supervision. Results indicate a strong relationship between student perception of value delivered to the client and their perception of the value of utilizing agile principles to achieve their goal.

These provided evidence of the strength of agile methodologies as a strategy that can speed up the development of rhythms and growth of innovation. Managing a project involves a complexity of requirements and developmental processes. This provides challenges to the project manager as he is accountable for the failure of a completed project. As such he is required to tackle any problems by adopting agile methodology during the development process. In Malaysia there is little research done to examine the behavior of the agile project manager. This study aims to analyze the behavior when project managers adopt agile in managing the development projects. Moreover, a review of the relevant literature has helped in developing an understanding of the agile project manager's behavior as this is necessary for them to become more agile inside development projects. For that reason, this paper has identified seven behaviors that the manager needs to adopt during software development process. These include Leadership, Openness, Results Orientation, Ethics, Communication, Strategic and Creative and Innovative. This paper contributes to the relevant theory by developing taxonomy of the agile project manager's behavior. Practitioners can use this taxonomy as a sensitizing device that helps the manager to consider behavior that promotes success of their projects. This is important to ensure an increase productivity and profitability, which are the business strategies of software development projects.","","978-1-4799-5439-1","10.1109/MySec.2014.6986020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986020","agile behavior;agile methodologies;agile project manager;leadership;communication;openness;strategic;result orientation;creative;innovative;ethics","Lead;Software;Project management;Ethics;Agile software development;Taxonomy;Collaboration","ethical aspects;human resource management;innovation management;project management;software development management","agile project manager behavior;software project management;agile methodology;innovation growth;software development process;leadership behavior;openness behavior;results orientation behavior;ethics behavior;communication behavior;strategic behavior;creative and innovative behavior","","7","","55","","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An online survey was posted out to agile special interest groups on popular social media platforms to discover the frequency of the job title ""project manager"" in agile projects. Analysis of the 97 responses from 31 countries around the world revealed that: a) the title of project manager is still widely used (67%); b) there is a correlation between the team size and presence of project manager such that there is a higher probability the project manager will be present in teams of 5-10 members and those over 25 members; and c) there is an inverse correlation between the co-location of a team and presence of project manager.

On most projects, schedule slips are common and cost increases are predictable. At the end of every iteration, some of our stories get dropped, usually due to reasons such as ""the story took longer than what we expected"", or ""we didn't find out scope X about the story until we were in the middle of the iteration"". Every slip and increase reduces total business value delivered and project overruns force other high-value projects to be delayed or canceled. Together these costs cause a large negative value impact that could be avoided. Agile needs a better way to measure total value delivered in relation to cost. Agile methods must encourage accountability for on-time delivery and scope, based on value and cost. What is missing in most agile implementations is a value-based feedback mechanism involving shared responsibility between the customer and the team. This experience report describes how one company addressed these challenges and the lessons learned: it explains how we achieved on-time delivery, assisted customers in selecting high value features, provided shared responsibility, and facilitated individual team member empowerment.

For many companies, this decision can be just as time-consuming, labor and cost intensive as the actual development itself. It is our belief that, as a key strategic decision, the buy vs. build process should make every effort to leverage the strengths of Agile. By applying Agile techniques to the buy vs. build process, organizations are able to accelerate and focus the decision-making process. Ultimately, the marriage of Agile and buy vs. build allows teams to maximize value to the business and keep the product development cycle as ""agile"" as possible. In this paper, we will explore our experiences in applying Agile techniques to help in this key decision.

Regression testing is such type of testing technique that is performed to corroborate and ensure the impact of any new code in the existing modules of the software product. Proper optimization practices can reduce the efforts and time required to conduct Regression Testing. Although, it is quite challenging to optimize regression testing activities. So there is a need to implement an automotive regression testing mechanism that is based on associated risks and test prioritization to reduce the testing time and effort of testing engineers. In this research paper, we discussed the challenges and strategies to develop optimized regression testing in Agile methodologies.

One of the main emphases of these methods is employing cross-functional and self-organized teams and highly skilled developers in software projects. In such a condition, project management would be a serious concern. Indeed, it would be confusing whether Agile teams are really in need of the role of the project manager. While Agile methodologies do not explicitly define the role of the project manager, many reports mention the existence of this role in Agile projects in real environments. So, it seems that the existence of this role is debated. Conducting a Systematic Literature Review, this study tried to find out answers to the ambiguities and questions regarding the role of Agile project management, the role of the project manager, and related issues. Focusing on the primary studies, the results show that there is no independent job called project manager in Agile methodologies. However, there is a need for it. Moreover, in the absence of this role in Agile methodologies and the need for it, it seems that this role would be structurally different from the traditional role of the project manager in terms of responsibilities and duties. Finally, the results show that pre-defined roles in Agile methodologies are often responsible for the project manager duties in software teams with no project manager.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3004450","Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), Malaysia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123372","Agile project management;Agile project manager;Agile software development;project manager;Scrum;systematic literature review","Project management;Software;Bibliographies;Systematics;Databases;Companies;Planning","project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","project manager duties;agile software teams;software projects;agile project management","","8","","67","CCBY","23 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the `goodness' of that method, is questionable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we propose a structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to assessing the `goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the principles, (4) linkages among the objectives, principles and practices, and (5) indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and the effectiveness of that practice. In this paper, we discuss our solution approach, preliminary results, and future work.","","978-1-4673-2622-3","10.1109/Agile.2012.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298091","Agile Assessment;Adequacy;Capability;Effectiveness;Linkages among Objectives;Principles;and Practices;Indicators","Organizations;Software;Couplings;Object recognition;Programming;Collaboration;Technological innovation","software prototyping","agile software development method;team;customized agile method;organizational objective;agile assessment approach;objectives-principles-practices;OPP framework;agile philosophy","","14","","15","","13 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the reality may not be as simple or linear as the term implies. To provide a better understanding of the combined use of agile and lean approaches in software development, a set of experience reports were analysed. These reports were published in the past conferences dedicated to agile software development and report experiences of using both agile and lean. The results of the analysis show that agile and lean can be combined in different manners for different purposes in software development. Lean is often applied as guiding principles for agile development. When combined at practice level, flow-based lean processes tend to substitute time-boxed agile processes.","","978-1-61284-426-8","10.1109/AGILE.2011.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005500","agile methods;agile software development;lean thinking;lean software development;XP;Scrum;experience report","Programming;Companies;Software;Data analysis;Systematics","software development management;software prototyping","agile software development;lean software development;experience report analysis;agile method;extreme programming;Scrum;time-boxed agile process","","14","","19","","29 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The project started as a grass-root F/OSS effort in late 2002 and received EU-funding from December 2004 until November 2006. In this paper we present the various influencing factors that creates the hybrid project process that is PyPy. These influencing factors are the F/OSS Python Community (climate of the community from which PyPy grew from), agile practices (such as the Python community evolved technique of ""sprinting"") and the EU funding practices (resource tracking and reporting) impacting the project. These influencing factors laid the foundation for the custom-made project process that makes this unique hybrid project work. The main factor for driving this process is the skills of the team of core developers instigating the project. PyPy, with its open and transparent communication and collaborative work style, is again a proof that the best agile practice is the people factor.","","0-7695-2562-8","10.1109/AGILE.2006.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667583","","Collaborative work;Open source software;Project management;Programming;Collaborative software;Testing","project management;team working;software development management;public domain software","PyPy open source project;agile practices;F/OSS Python Community;EU funding practices;custom-made project process;open communication;transparent communication;collaborative work style","","1","","4","","14 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile project management has been a potential solution to deliver successful IT projects instead of the traditional waterfall approach. This potential has resulted in organizations adopting agile project management to deliver IT projects on time and realise benefits. However, auditors especially those whose experience lies with more traditional and system development life cycle controls are struggling with how to audit agile projects. The problem addressed in this article is lack of an audit framework for auditing agile projects to ensure IT project success. The purpose of this article is to present the proposed conceptual framework for auditing agile projects that are implemented using Scrum methodology. The framework introduces audit processes in each process of the Scrum methodology. The quantitative research method used online survey questionnaire to validate the conceptual framework amongst IT professionals in South Africa. The data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0. The research revealed that there was a significant correlation between the identified audit processes and agile project success. This research emphasizes on the need to take into account auditing agile project from its initiation to closure. This article contributes to the body of knowledge with regard to project auditing.

Therefore, transforming the waterfall project management office (WPMO) into agile PMO (APMO) is a challenging topic, especially when the organizational structure is not built as strongly projectized structure. This research paper wisely analyzed a real case study for an IT organization to understand all issues facing the WPMO. As a result of this, the research implements a full flexible process called the Scalable Agile Transforming Process (SATP) to transform WPMO into APMO within an IT organization.

This framework specifically focuses on maximizing return on investment (ROI). Scrum, however, does not define how to manage and track costs to evaluate actual ROI against the vision. A reasonable cost measurement that integrates with Scrum would help provide an additional feedback loop. We adapted earned value management (EVM), using values defined in Scrum. The result is called AgileEVM (agile earned value management) and is a simplified set of earned value calculations. From the values in Scrum, we derived a release date estimate using mean velocity and from this equation, generated an equivalent equation using traditional EVM techniques, thus establishing the validity of using EVM with the Scrum framework. Finally, we used this technique on two projects to further test our hypothesis.

These user stories are then scoped in various sprint releases and delivered accordingly. Release planning in Agile becomes challenging when the number of user stories goes up in hundreds. In such scenarios it is very difficult to manually identify similar user stories and package them together into a release. Hence, this paper suggests application of natural language processing algorithms for identifying similar user stories and then scoping them into a release This paper takes the approach to build a word corpus for every project release identified in the project and then to convert the provided user stories into a vector of string using Java utility for calculating top 3 most occurring words from the given project corpus in a user story. Once all the user stories are represented as vector array then by using RV coefficient NLP algorithm the user stories are clustered into various releases of the software project. Using the proposed approach, the release planning for large and complex software engineering projects can be simplified resulting into efficient planning in less time. The automated commercial tools like JIRA and Rally can be enhanced to include suggested algorithms for managing release planning in Agile.","","978-1-5386-9346-9","10.1109/AICAI.2019.8701252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8701252","Natural Language Processing;Algorithm;Software Engineering;Agile Methodology;Release Planning;R Programming","Planning;Natural language processing;Software;Software engineering;Software algorithms;Currencies;Java","Java;natural language processing;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;team working","Java utility;Rally;JIRA;complex software engineering projects;RV coefficient NLP algorithm;word corpus;agile release planning;provided user stories;project release;similar user stories;user story;natural language processing algorithm","","4","","16","","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of such approach is “Agile Approach” also named as lightweight model for development. Agile is more about communication and collaboration between team members working on software project. For good quality software it's important to select the appropriate model for the development of software. Another factor that is important to be considered while model selection is that in what respect quality gets better if we choose either traditional or agile approach. Quality assurance techniques for traditional heavy weight development rely on inspections, reviews made at end whereas quality assurance techniques for agile light weight development rely on routine activities by teams. This paper aims to review various success factors of agile software development and various challenges faced in terms of assuring quality in agile.","","978-9-3805-4421-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7724451","Agile Methodology;Agile Software Development;Assuring Quality of development process;Critical Success Factors;Traditional Software Development;Quality Assurance (QA)","Quality assurance;Organizations;Agile software development;Software quality;Conferences;Adaptation models","software prototyping;software quality","agile quality development;software development methodologies;iterative incremental approach;software project;quality assurance techniques;agile light weight development;model selection","","","","20","","31 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prioritization of gathered requirements of a project is an uphill task for justifiable requirement engineering especially at the early phases of the development. Through relevant requirement prioritization, we can identify the exact requirements that must be included in a specific release. The main objective behind requirement prioritization is to decrease the associated risks in the development process. In Agile Software Development processes, it is not a cakewalk to prioritize the relevant requirements because requirements are welcomed even late in development phases in agile methodologies. This paper extracts information on discrete requirement prioritization approaches along with their strength and weaknesses. Through this paper, product owners will be in a condition to finalize a relevant prioritization approach according to the project's behavior and other constraints.","","978-1-6654-0360-3","10.1109/ICCMC51019.2021.9418285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9418285","Requirement Prioritization;Agile methodologies;MoSCoW;AHP;QFD","Agile software development;Documentation;Information retrieval;Software;Requirements engineering;Data mining;Task analysis","formal specification;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;systems analysis","Agile Software Development processes;relevant requirements;discrete requirement prioritization approaches;relevant prioritization approach;information extraction;software requirements;prime objectives;system requirement specification;gathered requirements;justifiable requirement engineering;relevant requirement prioritization;exact requirements","","2","","21","","6 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile use to keep track of the constant changing development environment [1]. For a traditional software development organization, highly effective techniques are required to adopt agile methodology. Adopting agile signifies shoring more cooperative environments and organizational policies that enable self-organization and team efficiency. The ability to meet client needs, improved software quality/fewer defects, reduced time and costs and the timely delivery of quality product are tremendous advantages of using agile development [2]. For a successful implementation of agile in an organization, transformation model needs to be used in an efficient manner. While adopting agile development, numbers of organizations come across issues and challenges along with their own projects success and failure stories. In order to identify the issues related to agile development adoption and its impact over the quality of end product, we have conducted a survey.

However, we have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) for the identification of motivators for adopting agile methods on a large scale from a management perspective. Thus, we have identified a total of 21 motivators for adopting agile methods on a large scale from a management perspective. Among these motivators, some were marked as critical motivators depending on variables, e.g., the factors critical in one variable might not be critical in another variable. The factors which were recorded as critical in all variables are strong executive support, agile development environment training and learning, agile development expertise, team competency, and briefing of top management on agile. Furthermore, we also found that the impact of different motivators was different depending on time and place for project manager guidance, i.e., some motivators were most critical in one region while less critical in another. Similarly, some of the motivators were more critical in previous decades but less critical in recent decades because of different improvements in software processes and technologies. These motivators are also analyzed from different angles, i.e., decade-wise and region wise for project managers guidance. The motivators are extracted from a sample of 58 research papers identified via an SLR process.

This research proposes NORMATIC, a Java-based simulation tool for modeling non-functional requirements for semi-automatic agile processes. NORMATIC is the semi-automatic tool that supports the more general Non-Functional Requirements Modeling for Agile Processes (NORMAP) Methodology. Early results show that the tool can potentially help agile software development teams in reasoning about and visually modeling NFRs as first-class artifacts early on during requirements gathering and analysis phases.

These remnant processes, mindsets, and cultures represent opportunities to improve the systemic value that agile approaches are capable of enabling. For example, in many large corporations the annual budgeting cycle drives a mindset that scope, budget, and schedule must be established up front, often many months before project work begins. Success means delivering on that scope within the budget and schedule commitments. In turn, this mindset of defining business investment opportunities upfront, coupled with a project mentality where work must be completed before the next budgeting cycle begins, drives ""big batch"" (waterfall-type) project approaches and supporting IT processes. As our IT teams successfully applied agile methods at the project level, we began to address our approach for managing portfolios of projects to increase the amount of value we deliver with our business partners. As we did this, we ran headlong into inherent conflicts between agile and legacy corporate processes and mindsets. We recognized the need to transform those legacy processes and mindsets so that we manage the portfolios of project investments in an agile manner.

The approach is validated through visual simulation and a case study.

These two themes are: UX practitionerspsila understanding of their job role, and the need to establish, protect and communicate an overall team vision. Techniques for integrating the end user perspective in agile projects are also reported.

Several books have been published exploring the lessons learned from manufacturing around lean. Some books have also taken the principles of lean manufacturing and provided the guidelines for adapting the same to software development. However, there is still a huge need for providing empirical evidence of application of lean principles to software development through real case studies. This paper attempts at making a contribution in that direction, by exploring the implementation of the ideas of continuous improvement and flow, which are so central to lean, on a real life industrial project. Besides exploring the practices that aid these concepts in agile software development, this paper also discusses some of the metrics that can be used for measuring and tracking progress of such a project. The study shows that applying the concepts of continuous improvement and flow to agile software development does seem to have significant benefits, and is something that needs to be extended further and applied to different project situations.","2326-6015","978-0-7695-4657-5","10.1109/AgileIndia.2012.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170019","Lean;agile;iterative;flow;end to end;software development;continuous improvement;kaizen","Programming;Interviews;Organizations;Measurement;Software;Industries;Production","agile manufacturing;lean production;software engineering","lean concepts;agile software development project;lean manufacturing;lean principles","","7","","18","","15 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result of these constraints management is often forced to make the difficult decision as to which stories to complete and which to ignore. The difficulty of this decision is compounded by a high degree of uncertainty within the business value of each story, the story size and also the resources available. This paper proposes a relatively simple statistical methodology that allows for uncertainty in these areas. In so doing it provides key stakeholders with the opportunity to manage uncertainty in the planning of what functionality to include in upcoming releases. The technique is lightweight in nature and consistent with existing agile planning practices. A case study is provided to demonstrate how the method may be used.","","978-0-7695-3321-6","10.1109/Agile.2008.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599454","Release Planning;Uncertainty;Requirements;Prioritization;Scheduling;Statistical Simulation","Uncertainty;Planning;Business;Software;Genetic algorithms;Estimation;Programming","planning;scheduling;software development management;statistical analysis;uncertainty handling","uncertainty handling;agile requirement prioritization;agile requirement scheduling;statistical simulation;constraints management;agile planning","","7","1","23","","15 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a quantitative data analysis approach, the PLS results of survey responses of 160 research participants suggest that agile enterprise architecture has positive effects on active communication, on-budget completion, functionality, and quality.

The Waterfall method consists of a series of stages that are completed sequentially, once a stage has been completed, developers can't go back to the previous stage - not without scratching the project and starting over. In order to remain competitive, companies developing hardware are using Agile methodologies to help keep up with the accelerating rate of change. Scrum is a simple and flexible Agile methodology that provides the ability to respond to changing requirements, increase productivity, and enables rapid and flexible development cycles, with greater collaboration and reduced costs & defects. Integrating a Reliability And Maintainability (RAM) Scrum Team as part of the Agile product development can help deliver reliable and maintainable hardware quicker, and at lower costs providing a competitive advantage. In summary help enable transformational change. Be open to process change and work your RAM agile process model. Don't impose current waterfall processes on Scrum, they will not help. Be supportive and review the team's work products during the Sprint timeline in which they are being developed. Don't expect to see a lot of charts for reviews and table tops and don't direct the team to do additional work or direct how it should be done. Look at the team Scrum boards to understand what is going on and help remove impediments. Staff the team's needs with permanent solutions and take Scrum training to understand, enable and support the changes.

For a software application to be valuable it should have a user interface that is usable. Recently there has been some evidence that suggests using agile methods alone does not ensure that an applications UI is usable. As a result, there is currently interest in combining Agile methods with user-centered design (UCD) practices. To support existing empirical evidence that these methodologies co-exist effectively we have conducted a study with participants that have previously combined these two methodologies. Our findings, combined with existing work show that the existing model used for agile UCD integration can be broadened into a more common model. In this paper we describe three different approaches taken by our participants to achieve this integration.

We compare this data with corresponding data from non-machine learning projects, in an attempt to analyze how machine learning projects are executed differently from normal software engineering projects. On analysis, we find that machine learning project issues use different kinds of words to describe issues, have higher number of exploratory or research oriented tasks as compared to implementation tasks, and have a higher number of issues in the product backlog after each sprint, denoting that it is more difficult to estimate the duration of machine learning project related tasks in advance.

More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the 'goodness' of that method, should be demonstrable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we present a systematic, comprehensive approach to assessing the 'goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We employ the Objectives, Principles and Strategies (OPS) Framework to guide our assessment process. The Framework (a) specifies objectives of the agile philosophy, (b) identifies principles that support the objectives, (c) designates strategies that implement the principles, (d) defines linkages that relate objectives to principles, and principles to strategies, and (e) prescribes indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and effectiveness of those strategies.

Among all agile methods, Scrum is the most popular as of today. Although, agile is well suitable for large organization with distributed systems. Agile method such as 'scrum' can be improved further and it can work with other process and automation tools coupled with agile artifacts to improve software development team's performance such a solution can be applied to large scale industries. As no one solution is best suitable for today's business, hence the concept of 'Agile Genome' is becoming more popular, which encourages organizations to use combination of other methods and automation tools that can be used based on the application. Hence there is a need of discussing areas where agile and automation can work together and finding different ways of utilizing full potential of agile methods along with automation tools to achieve maximum benefits for the software industries.","","978-1-7281-7283-5","10.1109/ICICT50521.2020.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9092149","agile method;software development;SQA","Software;Automation;Organizations;Industries;Agile software development;Tools;Testing","DP industry;project management;software architecture;software development management;software prototyping;software quality","software industry;organizations;popular software development strategy;agile methods;automation tools;agile artifacts;software development team;agile software development;SQA;agile genome","","","","14","","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article presents a systematic literature review that updates the Usman et al. study from 2014 to 2020 by analyzing the data extracted from 73 new papers. This analysis allowed us to identify six agile methods: Scrum, Xtreme Programming and four others, in all of which expert-based estimation methods continue to play an important role. This is particularly the case of Planning Poker, which is very closely related to the most frequently used size metric (story points) and the way in which software requirements are specified in ASD. There is also a remarkable trend toward studying techniques based on the intensive use of data. In this respect, although most of the data originate from single-company datasets, there is a significant increase in the use of cross-company data. With regard to cost factors, we applied the thematic analysis method. The use of team and project factors appears to be more frequent than the consideration of more technical factors, in accordance with agile principles. Finally, although accuracy is still a challenge, we identified that improvements have been made. On the one hand, an increasing number of papers showed acceptable accuracy values, although many continued to report inadequate results. On the other, almost 29% of the papers that reported the accuracy metric used reflected aspects concerning the validation of the models and 18% reported the effect size when comparing models.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3021664","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the Adapt@Cloud Project(grant numbers:TIN2017-84550-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9186107","Effort estimation;agile methods;agile software development (ASD);systematic literature review (SLR)","Estimation;Agile software development;Software;Variable speed drives;Planning;Systematics;Bibliographies","project management;regression analysis;software cost estimation;software development management;software prototyping","software requirements;ASD;thematic analysis method;project factors;agile principles;Agile Software Development;systematic literature review;Software developers;effective effort estimation models;project planning;agile methods;expert-based estimation methods;Planning Poker","","7","","61","CCBYNCND","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

What metric represents agile stability? Agile processes establish the principle the schedule is fixed and scope changes. Agile velocity is well defined. Velocity is how much technical scope a team of people can produce over a period of time. It ties the technical scope to the schedule. This research continues to develop the concept that a stable velocity is an important factor in the change management process and risk management process. Specifically, stable velocity can help prevent a chaotic relationship with the customer. If the velocity is stable from sprint to sprint, it means planning and the execution is well aligned. This research uses past data from software agile development projects to investigate whether a metric for change in technical scope provides a leading indicator for schedule risk. Specifically, this paper studies agile velocity and proposes two physics concepts derived from velocity, as new agile metrics: agile acceleration and agile jerk. This paper identifies agile acceleration as a trigger for change and agile jerk as an indicator for stability of a release. The process to incorporate the metrics into agile risk management is provided. This research is relevant to persons who participate and manage Agile development projects.

"How the Business Analyst supports and encourages collaboration on agile projects","D. D. Gregorio","Information Systems, Infrastructure, & Services - Systems Engineering, The MITRE Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730","2012 IEEE International Systems Conference SysCon 2012","26 Apr 2012","2012","","","1","4","Agile teams need the Business Analyst (BA) to clearly define and communicate the detailed user stories to ensure a successful product. MITRE's Corporate IT Systems Engineering department supports software development activities which recently adopted an agile methodology. Unlike the detailed requirements documentation of more traditional, waterfall-based projects, we have found the streamlined “user stories” inadequate for developers or testers. Our BA experiences with eliciting user story details and maintaining the backlog for sprint planning are a critical component to agile development. BA activities include grooming the backlog, documenting user stories with detailed contracts, and performing user story verification through testing. This paper will review the techniques we have used during agile projects to manage the sprint cycle, including templates for user story management. Capturing artifacts from other agile projects and documenting recommended agile process guidelines can help projects be successful through reuse and collaboration. Many agile projects generate artifacts that are lost or are created for the benefit of only their project and discarded when through. Agile encourages lean documentation in order to maximize agility. We established a repository using an internal website where we documented corporte IT processes and share agile templates and samples. This repository includes samples of sprint schedules, backlog lists, burn-down charts, retrospective items, and user stories. The corporate IT process recommends agile but also includes traditional waterfall guidance and correlates the two different approaches. All projects, whether they are agile or otherwise, need similar deliverables, including project schedules and project plans. In correlating agile considerations to a waterfall approach, we hope to ease the transition to agile. The process guidance and repository site promotes collaboration, reuse, and review among agile projects within the organization.","","978-1-4673-0750-5","10.1109/SysCon.2012.6189437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189437","agile;scrum;user stories;business analyst","Business;Documentation;Testing;Schedules;Software;Collaboration","organisational aspects;project management;software maintenance;software management;software prototyping;Web sites","business analyst;agile projects;MITRE Corporate IT Systems Engineering department;software development activities;agile methodology;waterfall-based projects;user story detail elicitation;backlog maintenance;sprint planning;agile development;user story verification;sprint cycle management;user story management;lean documentation;internal Web site;corporate IT processes;agile templates;agile samples;sprint schedules;backlog lists;burn-down charts;retrospective items;project schedules;project plans","","12","","4","","26 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DTE Energy has such a combination: its lightweight yet CMMI-compatible methodology is now used within its 600+ person IT organization to deliver and support working software. Its small teams embrace core agile principles as they provide ""just enough"" solutions that satisfy maturing business needs.

The analysis of each collected agile method is based on three main factors. The first factor is the agile values of a method, which are related with the agile manifesto. The next two analyses compare the agile methods on their management practice values and engineering practice values. The results indicate that agile software development methods only support certain phases of the software development life cycle. Also, most agile methods in this survey do not provide sufficient support for project management.

The findings identify significant variance between business lines, specifically between product development and software development functions and their ability to follow agile guidelines. Generally across the organisation there was limited evidence of tailoring to context, an important organisational success factor, yet there was a more significant level of tailoring and responsiveness to client needs and wishes. Overall, there was a lack of clarity about the location of the decoupling points following the scoping of the project. Recommendations therefore require further attention and understanding of the implications of new practices employed by organisations, not least by senior management and for additional research underpinning such discovery.","1530-1605","978-1-4799-7367-5","10.1109/HICSS.2015.532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070352","Project Management Methodologies;Agile Project Management;Tailoring;Barriers to Adoption","Context;Companies;Project management;Product development;Software;Interviews","information systems;product development;project management;software prototyping","agile management practices adoption;project environment;agile project management methodologies;PMM;agile approaches;information technology;information systems;IT/IS projects;business lines;product development;software development functions;agile guidelines;organisational success factor;senior management","","3","","44","","30 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, North Dakota State University uses a set of processes modeled after CMMI level 2. However, over the past several years, many sponsoring companies have transitioned towards agile software development processes. In order to better prepare students for this, it is necessary to provide capstone projects offering an agile option as well as the more traditional methods. Interviews were conducted with developers and managers from five sponsoring companies using agile processes. The results of these interviews and feedback from student teams that have used agile are being used to create an agile software development process designed for capstone projects.

Unlike the overly simplistic business value prioritization scheme used in methodologies such as Scrum, Non-functional Requirements Planning (NORPLAN) proposes two additional prioritization schemes, namely, Riskiest-Requirements-First and Riskiest-Requirements-Last for improved yet more agile planning for release and sprint cycles using a risk-driven approach.

However, the flow of work faces many impediments as it flows through teams and organizations. Agile and lean approaches can reveal impediments that impact teams and organizations. Often at the start of their agile transition, but also frequently after the initial transition, teams and organizations can find themselves with a significant quantity of impediments that demand attention. With limited time and capacity, they need techniques to help them understand the impediments and make decisions about where to invest their time. This paper introduces a new technique called Impediment Impact Diagrams that helps people to understand which impediments to address, and who needs to be involved in addressing them. The technique can also be used to understand other attributes of impediments such as the relative cost of removing the impediment, or the relative duration it is likely to take to remove the impediments. The Impediment Impact Diagram can be used on its own or as part of an Impediment Removal Process. Drawing from original research on impediment removal, this paper includes detailed steps to use the technique, presents several examples of Impediment Impact Diagrams from multiple teams and organizations, and describes their experiences with the technique.","","978-1-4799-5798-9","10.1109/AGILE.2014.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910402","impediment;flow;waste;agile;lean;impediment impact diagram;decision making;impediment categories;capacity;action research;adaptive action;human systems dynamics;stakeholder;visualization","Organizations;Conferences;Adaptive systems;Context;Adaptation models;Europe","software prototyping","impediment impact diagrams;agile teams;agile organizations;agile transition;impediment removal process","","3","","20","","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software development is very complex process and requires multidimensional growth. Having a single model like waterfall or prototype for development is not enough for the product requirements and thus agile development is most useful for customized product development. With adaptive nature and early delivery and flexible life cycle, Agile is best suited for quick and effective development of software. The researchers also suggest that agile adaptation gives maturity to the organization and helps in the CMM levels achievement. There are various frameworks for agile but some can be more complex or overwhelming to agile beginner and so amongst all, scrum provides an easy method to implement agile. Scrum is currently the top most technique used in development not only for software but even in the fields of finance, research etc. If we are able to address the few backlogs it has, Scrum can undoubtedly become the most sought after method to be chosen for development with no hassles.","","978-1-5090-6471-7","10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8229928","SCRUM;SCRUM model;Agile;Scaling Agile through SCRUM","Scrum (Software development);Software;Automation;Planning;Scalability;Organizations","software development management;software prototyping","development prototype;agile beginner;CMM levels achievement;agile adaptation;flexible life cycle;adaptive nature;customized product development;agile development;product requirements;multidimensional growth;software development;IT companies;agile methodology;SCRUM model","","36","","13","","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study helps clarify the concept of agility within a big data science project, as well as the key process challenges teams encounter when executing a big data science project. Specifically, three key issues were identified: (a) the challenge in task duration estimation, (b) how to account for team members that might be pulled onto other tasks for short bursts and (c) coordination challenges across the different groups within the big data science team. Our findings help explain how different process methodologies might mitigate or exacerbate these challenges and supports previous research showing that big data science teams would benefit from an increased focus on their process methodology and that adopting an Agile Kanban methodology, which focuses on minimizing work-in-progress, could prove beneficial for many big data science teams.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005493","Big Data Science;Agile;Process Methodology","Big Data;Data science;Task analysis;Software;Data models;Limiting;Estimation","Big Data;kanban;project management;software management;software prototyping;team working","Agile Kanban methodology;team agile process methodology;Big Data science team;Big Data science project;agile Big Data science","","3","","38","","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The team decides how big a point is, and based on that size, determines how many points each work item is. In many organizations, the use of story points for similar features can vary from team to another, and successfully, based on the teams' sizes, skill set and relative use of this tool. But in a CMMI organization, this technique demands a degree of consistency across teams for a more streamlined approach to solution delivery. This generates a challenge for CMMI organizations to adopt Agile in software estimation and planning. In this paper, a process and methodology that guarantees relativity in software sizing while using agile story points is introduced. The proposed process and methodology are applied in a CMMI company level three on different projects. By that, the story point is used on the level of the organization, not the project. Then, the performance of sizing process is measured to show a significant improvement in sizing accuracy after adopting the agile story point in CMMI organizations. To complete the estimation cycle, an improvement in effort estimation dependent on story point is also introduced, and its performance effect is measured.","","978-1-4799-5798-9","10.1109/AGILE.2014.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910398","CMMI;Agile;Story Point;Software Estimation","Estimation;Organizations;Libraries;Software;Complexity theory;Size measurement;Productivity","organisational aspects;software development management;software prototyping","estimation cycle;effort estimation;sizing accuracy;software planning;software estimation;team consistency degree;story point measure;CMMI organizations;agile story points","","9","","22","","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We conducted interviews with eleven practitioners from three local software development companies to gain preliminary evidence of the practicality of the approach. Participants were questioned about their challenges in agile development and about their overall impressions of a concept mapping approach. We asked about the practicality and acceptability of implementing such a methodology, along with general concerns and recommendations. Results indicate that there is a need for improvement in agile usability, and a concept mapping approach is promising for addressing existing concerns.

XP has been used for the development of other agile methods, for example, “adaptive software development process model” (ASDPM), which is the modified approach of XP. ASDPM was proposed to support the following activities: “(a) communication and planning, (b) analysis, (c) design and development, and (d) testing”. Based on our literature review of ASDPM, we identify that ASDPM does not support the following: (i) how to identify the different types of agile team members who will participate during the communication and planning phase?; and (ii) how to deliver the most important requirements of the software during analysis phase?. Therefore, in order to address this issue and to strengthen the analysis phase of agile process models, in this paper we propose an extended adaptive process model (APM) for agile software development methodology. This method includes the following steps: (1) identification of agile team members, (2) communication and planning, (3) analysis includes the computation of function point of each requirement; and the selection and prioritization of the requirements, (4) design and development, (5) testing. Finally, the utilization of the proposed method is demonstrated with the help of Institute Examination System, as a case study.","","978-1-5090-6106-8","10.1109/ICICICT1.2017.8342770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8342770","Agile methods;XP;adaptive software development;function point","Software;Adaptation models;Agile software development;Planning;Testing;Analytical models;Variable speed drives","project management;software development management;software prototyping;software quality","XP;ASDPM;agile team members;planning phase;analysis phase;agile process models;agile software development methodology;communication phase;adaptive process model;eXtreme programming;adaptive software development process model;testing;design and development;Institute examination system","","","","25","","23 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our study resulted in the following findings: (1) requirements dependencies occur in agile projects and are important to these projects' success just as this is known for `traditional' software projects'; (2) requirements dependencies (i) were considered and treated as part of risk management, (ii) were deemed a responsibility of the individual team members, and (iii) mostly did affect project planning; (3) continuous communication and collaboration - two essential features of any agile method, were found critical to mitigating the risks due to dependencies; (4) a hybrid approach to architecture between agile and plan-driven methods was perceived to yield maximum scalability and help coping with dependencies; (5) `cross-cutting concerns', a category of dependencies, were not uniformly understood in an agile context and require more research.","2151-1357","978-1-4673-2914-9","10.1109/RCIS.2013.6577679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577679","agile requirements engineering;requirements dependencies;cross-cutting concerns;agile software development;qualitative research;focus groups;grounded theory","Software;Companies;Context;Industries;Communities;Cognition;Software engineering","software prototyping","requirements handling;agile projects;agile software development;software projects;requirements dependencies;plan-driven methods","","20","","64","","15 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional film industry has to become more agile in order to react quickly and easily to unexpected changes and competitive pressure. Despite the benefits of agility demonstrated in software development and successfully integrated agility into project management, the adaptation in creative industries such as content development for film production have largely been neglected. To determine the potential value for agility in the film industry, we build on theory about agile project management and examine in an online survey with 184 German filmmakers (producers, authors, directors, actors, film financiers), if the Agile Manifesto values and principles from the Software Development can be adapted to the film industry. Based on our data, we validated the agile manifesto for the film industry with content development specific four values related to nine own principles. Our results show that it is crucial to digitalize traditional content development to agile content development end-to-end, with digital tools, lean processes, new collaboration structures and holacracy to prepare for any volatility. Our findings help to get a better understanding of the agile manifesto beyond the Software Development as a guideline for implementing agility in the Film Industry.","","978-1-6654-4091-2","10.1109/TEMSCON-EUR52034.2021.9488606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488606","Agile Manifesto;Agile Project Management;Agility;Agile Methods;Film Industry","Pandemics;Entertainment industry;Project management;Collaboration;Production;Documentation;Tools","cinematography;computer aided instruction;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping","agile project management;traditional development processes;linear content development processes;traditional film industry;software development;film production;film financiers;Agile Manifesto values;content development specific four values;traditional content development;agile content development end-to-end","","","","31","","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its pace can keep up with change. Adding a fourth - Embrace Collective Responsibility - provides resiliency. The fifth - Solve Systemic Problems - expands agility beyond the actor boundary. To assess an actor, measure its conformance to these Agile Base Patterns. Agile researchers often frame their activities against the descriptive Agile Manifesto for Software Development.

Quantitative project data was collected, and project managers interviewed, on several issues related to estimates, key project properties, and project outcome. It was found that in projects where collaboration was facilitated by daily communication between the contractor and the customer, they experienced a lesser magnitude of effort overruns.

We established a framework for that language, organizing our thoughts into three areas: principles, practices, and benefits. When talking with visionaries or evangelists, we speak in terms of principles to understand why agile is the way it is. With practitioners or pragmatists, we speak in terms of practices to understand how to do agile. With skeptics, we speak in terms of benefits to determine whether agile is a good thing for us.

Although prior studies have investigated performance outcomes of agile projects, agile practices’ consequences on a project team's collaborative processes have not yet been thoroughly analyzed. It also remains unclear whether practices on a higher organizational level, such as project portfolio management (PPM), support or constrain agile practices’ benefits, especially if a firm simultaneously conducts traditionally managed and agile projects. Therefore, this article investigates the role of agile practices for a project's teamwork quality (TWQ) and project success and examines the influence of organizational contingencies. Specifically, we conceptually and empirically analyze the moderating impact of PPM practices on the relationship between agile practices, TWQ, and project success. A multi-informant analysis of 378 projects nested in 100 portfolios shows that agile practices positively relate to project success through TWQ. We find that traditional PPM practices such as business case existence, strategic clarity, and operational control constrain this relationship.

Malaysian Software Engineering Conference (MySEC)","18 Dec 2014","2014","","","255","259","This paper presents the review of literatures that shows the contribution of the agile methodology towards teaching and learning environment at university level. Teaching and learning at university has since migrated from traditional learning to active learning methodology where students are expected to learn by doing rather than listening passively to lectures alone. The agile methodology naturally has promoted the active participation of team members during system development phases. The nature of agile development methodology has been identified as abundantly compatible and supportive towards active academic learning. Some literature have proposed ways of adopting agile into active learning to improve teaching and learning processes and have highlighted this method as a great success. With the review presented in this paper, we would like to highlight how efficient the agile concept is in tackling several situations in academic learning as shown by an interesting mapping of agile principles to the classroom environment. With that, we hope to bring more options to improve active teaching and learning delivery by adopting agile methodology. On the other hand, few papers have used the academic environment to measure the agile principles. By highlighting this, we offer options for the agile evaluation framework to consider academic environment as a tool to obtain the agile performance feedback.","","978-1-4799-5439-1","10.1109/MySec.2014.6986024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986024","Agile;agile education;agile e-learning;teaching and learning;active learning","Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Software;Collaboration;Software engineering;Programming","computer aided instruction;teaching","agile methodology;learning activity;learning environment;university level;learning methodology;team members;system development phases;agile development methodology;active academic learning;teaching process;learning process;agile principles;classroom environment;active teaching;learning delivery;academic environment;agile evaluation framework;agile performance feedback","","7","","11","","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Comparison between traditional plan-based and agile software processes according to team size & project domain (A systematic literature review)","N. Keshta; Y.

Since the traditional plan-based methods are rigorous and not flexible with changing requirements, some projects are postponed, go over budget, and are sometimes canceled or started from scratch. Questions remain on whether the traditional plan-based approaches will be replaced by agile. For effective, flexible and high-quality projects, organizations are shifting to flexible methods, where they can change the requirements at any stage of the development process. The purpose of this paper is to compare the plan-based and agile software development processes. The paper will discuss the art of deciding which methodology should be used with regard to the team size and the project domain. In the paper a systematic literature review covers 26 papers between 2000 and 2016. The papers are selected with reference to the size of the team and the domain of the project. The result of the paper illustrate that each methodology has a specific area which it best fits in. An organization should consider all factors and choose the methodology according to the situation. Finally, Agile best fits with small team sizes, for exploratory, and software & web-based projects. Traditional methods best fit large team sizes, for predictable, and reusable artifacts projects. However, they can co-exist.","","978-1-5386-3371-7","10.1109/IEMCON.2017.8117128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8117128","agile;plan-based;software development process;traditional methods;systematic Literature Review;Team Size;Project domain","","project management;software development management;software process improvement;software prototyping;software reusability","systematic literature review;high-quality projects;flexible methods;agile software development processes;Agile best fits;team size;software projects;plan-based approaches;project domain;Web-based projects","","4","","23","","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This mindset has been promoting the use and development of several tools that aim to minimize risks associated to the project output, i.e., in Agile the user requirements are the major priority and the risk associated to these requirements is strongly mitigated using tools like Scrum or Kanban. However, risk analysis in Agile projects has an implicit nature without well-defined and systematic methods. This feature was inherited from the software industry where this implicit approach works well, but for industries different from those that develop software it creates serious drawbacks. In fact, the risk associated to the project itself, or in other words, the risk associated to the Agile team capability to implement and manage a given project is not explicitly analyzed in Agile methods. Moreover, the Agile risk mitigation approach do not consider this important point of view in risk management. In this sense, important risk factors have been omitted, risk factors such as scope creep, unrealistic expectations, lack of cooperation, or lack of communication are some of these factors that have been overlooked despite their strong impact on Agile projects. This paper proposes a new approach to perform risk assessment and management of Agile projects. The approach comprises a set of qualitative risk tools inline with the Agile way of doing things, i.e., the proposed model does not jeopardize the flexibility found in Agile methods so appreciated by Agile team members, but at the same time, the proposed model introduces a systematic way of risk analysis which absence in Agile projects has been criticize in literature.","","978-1-7281-5678-1","10.1109/YEF-ECE49388.2020.9171808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9171808","risk assessment;risk management;agile;fuzzy logic;project development;project management","","project management;risk analysis;software development management;software prototyping","risk management;agile projects;qualitative risk tools;agile team members;risk analysis;risk assessment approach;software industry;project management mindset;agile risk mitigation approach;agile methods;agile team capability","","1","","10","","20 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To investigate this issue, a case study and an additional external survey were conducted. The impact has been identified according to the aggregated enterprise agility dimensions, which are interconnected. Based on the survey, it can be stated that the impact depends on the number of interfaces into the organisation and the management commitment. The impact, however, can be a double-edged sword, as when the agile mindset is fostered, conflicts can arise when people are released, after agile projects, back into the old structures of the organisation. The survey also revealed that practitioners believe that after an agile project, there is the need for an agile support team in order to avoid a break in the agile supply chain. Furthermore, agile project management impacts the HR-processes, as the competence profiles of the employees are influenced. Consequently, agile project management can be seen as the gem cell for agility in (parts of) an organisation, whether this is wanted or not, due to its influence. Depending on the amount of agile project work, the organisation has to handle the VUCA-environment accordingly, where agile project management can help to learn and transfer agility into the organisation step by step until the desired and required need. Nonetheless, change management should be applied in any cases to ensure the right outcome.","","978-1-6654-1978-9","10.1109/E-TEMS51171.2021.9524863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524863","agile project management;agile support teams;competence profiles","Supply chains;Project management;Europe;Hardware;Research and development management","organisational aspects;project management;supply chain management","agile support team;agile supply chain;agile project management;organisation;aggregated enterprise agility dimensions;VUCA-environment","","","","49","","1 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we presented three limitations to the current agile planning tools and we developed three features to overcome them. A questionnaire is used to evaluate the identified limitations and the proposed features. The evaluation shows that the identified limitations are sound and exist in the real software projects. In addition, most of the participants agree about how to implement the first and second proposed features (providing task effort notification and improving user story prioritization). The evaluation of the third feature (adding new user story/re-prioritize user story by customer) shows that the simple implementation provided for this feature is not sufficient and, hence, there is a need for a more thorough study to best involve customers through agile planning tools.

The foundation of environmental change lies in changing paradigms to flexible models of Agile project life cycles, decision-making in conditions of uncertainty based on data mining from rational to irrational. The article investigates modern information models that change the systems of competencies of project managers, approximate models, and methods of decision making. The patterns of behavior of project managers in creating a project product and project management are studied. The patterns allowed the authors to identify bottlenecks in the application of Agile project management methodologies in the convergence of trend information models and technologies.","","978-1-7281-7470-9","10.1109/SIST50301.2021.9465910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465910","Leadership;information technology;competence;behavior pattern;Agile manager","Leadership;Uncertainty;Biological system modeling;Decision making;Knowledge based systems;Project management;Market research","business data processing;data mining;decision making;globalisation;human resource management;organisational aspects;project management","smart systems;rational economy;behavioral economy;knowledge systems;project managers;decision making;agile project management methodologies;trend information models;information technology;project management competencies;project portfolios;global trends;cloud technologies;fog technologies;leadership modeling;agile project life cycles;blockchain;digitalization;digitalization;data mining;project product creation","","","","18","","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research proposes three fundamental agile artifacts to model FRs, NFRs, and their potential solutions in a visual environment. First, FRs are modeled through Agile Use Cases (AUCs). Second, NFRs are modeled through Agile Loose Cases (ALCs). Third, NFRs potential solutions are modeled through Agile Choose Cases (ACCs). AUCs are newly proposed hybrid of use cases and agile user stories. ALCs are proposed loosely-defined agile NFRs. ACCs are proposed potential solutions (operationalizations) for ALCs. The three artifacts are combined in a visual framework to promote agile modeling of NFRs (primarily) and how they are linked to FRs. The artifacts are the building blocks of a more comprehensive framework for modeling NFRs in agile software development processes.","1558-058X","978-1-4673-1375-9","10.1109/SECon.2012.6196988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6196988","Agile Requirements Modeling;Agile Use Case;Agile Loose Case;Agile Choose Case;NFRs;Scrum;NORMAP Methodology","Programming;Visualization;Joining processes;User interfaces;Encryption;Business","formal specification;software prototyping","lightweight engineering artifacts;nonfunctional requirements;agile processes;agile software development;agile artifacts;agile use cases;agile loose cases;agile choose cases;agile user stories;visual framework;agile modeling","","12","","19","","10 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Formed in 1967, OCLC develops software for use by libraries and their users, museums, and academic institutions. Researchers, students, faculty, scholars, professional librarians and other information seekers use OCLC services to obtain bibliographic, abstract and full-text information. OCLC aims to be the leading global library cooperative. More than 54,000 libraries in 96 countries and territories around the world use OCLC services to locate, acquire, catalog, lend and preserve library materials. This paper examines how TCC, a training and consultancy company from Cheshire, England has worked with OCLC, the Online Computer Library Center based in Dublin, Ohio to incorporate the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) into a development culture that was deeply-rooted in ""traditional"" software development methods. Examples from multiple projects illustrate how the adoption of DSDM helped OCLC change its culture and achieve success in software development and deployment. OCLC's TLC dashboard was used to track the effectiveness of the development cycle, and to collect metrics from 2003 to the present.

This is problematic given the strategic and economic importance of software industry in countries such as Saudi Arabia. This paper aims to start addressing this research gap with an empirical investigation of the awareness and perceptions of Agile among software practitioners in Saudi Arabia and the extent to which they are adopting Agile methods. To this end, we conduct four semi-structured interviews with expert software practitioners and a survey with 31 respondents, all from the mobile development software industry. Our findings indicate that there it seems to be a low level of awareness and usage of Agile in the country.

There is no notable evidence in existing literature that testing in agile methodologies improve the quality of software compared to other methodologies. We chose a real world project and employed three teams to work on the same project following three different methodologies (Waterfall, Agile and Agile with Dynamic Quality Control) and collected data to compare the effectiveness of testing in each methodology in real world project scenario.

Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) has been used to review the related articles systematically. From this mapping study, it is seen that 14 aspects related to documentation in agile were investigated, showing that how important is to have ‘just enough” documentation in agile. Based on these aspects it can be analyzed that why do projects lack in competing with time and cost.

Core to the approach is the use of risk and cost to determine the architectural significance of concerns. Agility is achieved by keeping the architecture lightweight, addressing only those concerns that are especially risky or costly. A risk- and cost-driven backlog of architectural concerns balances the generally value-driven product backlog to achieve “just enough anticipation” in the evolution of software solutions.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2014.111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6898730","software engineering;project management;agile;architecture","Computer architecture;Agile manufacturing;Software engineering;Pragmatics;Project management","costing;risk management;software architecture;software prototyping","agile architecture;solution architecting approach;risk-driven architecture;cost-driven architecture;software agility;risk-driven backlog;cost-driven backlog;value-driven product backlog;software solutions","","10","","4","","15 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Despite these drastic changes, the creative industries want and need to preserve their cultural heritage to overcome volatility. A potential way for the creative industry to face these changes may be to transform creative projects towards agile project management. Due to the popularity and success of agility in project management in software domains, extant research details the benefits and challenges of agility and agile methods, but we lack a comprehensive picture of a possible integration of agility in creative industries. Therefore, this paper systematically reviews the literature on agility and agile methods in the creative industries and develops a framework that focuses particularly on the audiovisual industries such as motion picture, music, mobile and video gaming industry. Based on our framework, we identified eleven specific drivers of agile project management for the creative industries within our 31 paper. Overall, our results identify a significant potential for future research on agile project management in creative industries and emphasize agility as an `accelerator' of transformation.","","978-1-6654-4091-2","10.1109/TEMSCON-EUR52034.2021.9488611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488611","Agile Project Management;Agile Methods;Creative industries;Content;Motion Picture Industry;Film Industry;Video Industry;Music Industry;Video Gaming Industry","Industries;Systematics;Project management;Europe;Transforms;Tools;Streaming media","computer games;history;organisational aspects;project management;reviews;software prototyping","systematic literature review;creative industry;agile methods;agile project management;creative projects","","1","","53","","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aims: Our objective is to gain a deeper understanding of how organisations adopt agile development methods in distributed settings. Specifically we aim to plot the current development process landscape in GSD. Method: We analyse industrial survey data from 33 different countries collected as part of the HELENA project that explored the wider use of hybrid development approaches in software development. We extract and analyse the results of 263 surveys completed by participants involved in globally distributed projects. Results: In our sample, 72% of globally distributed projects implement a mix of both agile and traditional approaches (termed `hybrid'). 25% of GSD projects are predominantly agile, with only very few (2%) opting for traditional approaches. GSD projects that used only agile methods tended to be very large. Conclusions: Globally Distributed Software Development (and project size) is not a barrier to adopting agile practices. Yet, to facilitate project coordination and general project management, many adopt traditional approaches, resulting in a hybrid approach that follows defined rules.","1949-3789","978-1-7281-2968-6","10.1109/ESEM.2019.8870168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870168","Global Software Development;Agile software development;software process;hybrid development approaches;GSD","Software;Organizations;Standards organizations;Instruments;Task analysis;Planning","project management;software development management;software prototyping","plan-driven approaches;Agile global Software Development;agile methods;co-located teams;successful agile adoption;global software development setting;agile development methods;distributed settings;HELENA project;hybrid development approaches;globally distributed projects;GSD projects;project size;agile practices;project coordination;general project management;industrial survey data analysis","","8","","59","","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a diversity of roles might be beneficial in teaching agile methods in an academic setting. This reflective educational paper describes the evolution of an industry sourced problem-based agile student project, which over three successive years has included students from three different faculties. Although the experience has broadly been positive each year, this paper describes and reflects on both the good and problematic observations that the teaching staff has made over the years. The changes of the projects has been based by reflecting on these insights. These reflections are described and several recommendations are drawn from the experiences. These include, that it is important that the cohorts collaborate and work together in parallel. Individual groups, of diverse cohorts, should work in isolation.

However, the risk of project failure or time and budget overruns is still a relevant problem. This paper aims to present and discuss a new approach to model some key risk factors in agile development, using software process simulation modeling (SPSM), which can complement other approaches, and whose usage is particularly suited for agile development. We introduce a new approach to modeling some key risk factors – namely project duration, number of implemented issues, and key statistics of issue completion time – using a simulator of agile development, which we developed for this purpose. The approach includes modeling the agile process, gathering data from the tool used for project management, and performing Monte Carlo simulations of the process, to get insights about the expected time and effort to complete the project, and about their distributions. The model’s parameters that can cause risk are errors in effort estimation of the features to develop, variations in developers’ assignment to these features, impediments related to developers’ availability and work completion. To validate the simulator, and to demonstrate how the method can be used, we analyzed three open-source projects, gathering their data from JIRA repositories. We ran Monte Carlo simulations of these projects, showing that the simulator can well approximate the progress of the real project, then varying the identified risk factors and statistically evaluating their effects on the risk parameters. The proposed approach is relevant for project managers, being able to quantitatively evaluate the risks, provided that the process and the project’s data are properly modeled and gathered. As for the future, we are working to improve our risk assessment method, evaluating it on more case studies, scaling the model from a single team to multiple teams involved in one or more projects.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115941","Project: “Gestione documentale” - Programmazione Unitaria 2007–2013 Interventi a sostegno della competitività e dell’innovazione, ai sensi della D.G.R. n. 33/41 dell’8.08.2013 - Bando Pacchetti Integrati di Agevolazione “Industria, Artigianato e Servizi” (annualità 2013), in attuazione della D.G.R. n. 46/20 del 31.10.2013 Prot. 283 CUP: E2 6G14000820007; Project: ABATA - Applicazioni della Blockchain per l’Autenticità e la tracciabilità Alimentare n.

To specifically address the latter challenge, we created a lightweight release framework in order to optimize on-time, high quality delivery to our customers and partners. Salesforce.com delivers product functionality using the software-as-a-service hosted model and has 30+ scrum teams working on a single release concurrently. The release framework that we created exhibitscharacteristics different than most release processes--simple, lightweight, unambiguous, and visibleeverywhere, to our entire technology organization. By implementing this lightweight release framework and making it highly visible, wepsilave organically promoted a cyclical harmony and rhythm in our organization and across all scrum teams. This cyclical harmony and rhythm has created an environment where local team agility is promoted, facilitated and thrives. To support an agile methodology effectively on an enterprise scale, a lightweight release framework is highly useful in empowering small self-organizing teams while ""optimizing the whole"" of the product you are focused on delivering. Interestingly enough, we found that the absence of one can actually inhibit agility and avoidable ambiguity, in an environment where there is a high degree of unavoidable ambiguity.","","978-0-7695-3321-6","10.1109/Agile.2008.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599481","agility;enterprise;rhythm;flow;release management;release;framework;adm;adaptive development methodology;saas","Organizations;Rhythm;Schedules;Team working;Lead;Automation;Games","sales management;software development management","lightweight release framework;adaptive development methodology;software-as-a-service hosted model;technology organization","","1","1","","","15 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Micro Devices, Singapore","The IET International Conference on Agile Manufacturing","8 Aug 2007","2007","","","74","77","A traditional approach to management of engineering projects invariably tends to prescribe a predefined process. In semiconductor manufacturing, a standard approach to process control involves the application of a predefined mathematical model that sufficiently describes the relationship between inputs and outputs of a physical system Such a model is effective in controlling physical processes, however, when the objective is to manage human processes then a predefined control model may no longer be able lo sufficiently describe the relationship between inputs and outputs, requirements and deliverables. In cases where human processes are to be managed, an empirical model is often able to more readily adapt to emergent characteristics in a project. An empirical model is one which does not attempt to comprehensively describe the system with a predefined formula, but simply adjusts the inputs respective to observed changes in the outputs with the objective of billing the target. The idea of empirical process control is an underpinning of agile development methodologies such as Scrum and provides a pragmatic basis for management of engineering projects in general. The rationale for this assertion follows logically from a common sense perspective about the uncertainty of future events.","","978-0-86341-816-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286476","","","agile manufacturing;process control;project management","empirical engineering project management;semiconductor manufacturing;process control;agile development","","","","","","8 Aug 2007","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, difficulties persist which prevent development teams' from reaping the full benefit of practicing Agile. From a review of case studies of Agile applications,it was observed that developers' ceased to practice Agile methods in aspects that related to working in teams. In these aspects, they regressed to waterfall methods, in the sense that developers worked in functional silos with little communication as the project progressed. As an attempt to resolve this, the system dynamics framework was applied in analyzing the Agile case studies. This allowed for an assessment of the progression of the problem over time, as an outcome of feedback loops caused by developers reacting to the outcomes of their previous actions. From doing so, the quietly escalating problem of information being withheld between developers in a single project team was understood to be the primary cause of failure. The study concludes by recommending the importance of open communication between developers, and acknowledging work done beyond the teams plan.","2157-362X","978-1-5386-6786-6","10.1109/IEEM.2018.8607430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8607430","Agile Scrum;software development;system dynamics;teamwork behavior;waterfall development","Software;Productivity;Scrum (Software development);System dynamics;Task analysis;Industries;Conferences","productivity;software development management;software prototyping;software quality;team working","single software project;software development;development teams;single project team;agile case studies;agile methods;agile applications;agile scrum team","","2","","14","","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We prepared, performed, and evaluated an agile educational concept for the new Master of Science program Digital Transformation organized and provided by the department of business computing at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts - Hochschule Hannover in Germany. The course deals with innovative methodologies of agile project management and is attended by 25 students. We performed the class due the summer term in 2019 and 2020 as a teaching pair. The eduScrum method has been used in different educational contexts, including higher education. During the approach preparation, we decided to use challenges, problems, or questions from the industry. Thus, we acquired four companies and prepared in coordination with them dedicated project descriptions. Each project description was refined in the form of a backlog (list of requirements). We divided the class into four eduScrum teams, one team for each project. The subdivision of the class was done randomly. Since we wanted to integrate realistic projects into industry partners' implementation, we decided to adapt the eduScrum approach. The eduScrum teams were challenged with different projects, e.g., analyzing a dedicated phenomenon in a real project or creating a theoretical model for a company's new project management approach. We present our experiences of the whole process to prepare, perform and evaluate an agile educational approach combined with projects from practice. We found, that the students value the agile method using real world problems. However, the results are mainly based on the summer term 2019, this paper also includes our learnings from virtual distance teaching during the Covid 19 pandemic in summer term 2020.

In parallel, other studies indicate that the emergence of agile methods in the 90s led to the formation of high performance teams with great level of knowledge in technical, business and behavioral domains. For this reason, we have proposed a training method called Software Kaizen, which provides temporary immersion of a team in a high-performance environment, based on agile methodologies.

But is that the real picture -- and has there been a change in how companies work within these fields over the past two years? By conducting interviews with eight companies, this paper tries to answer these two questions. The companies were initially interviewed in 2013 and by follow-up interviews in 2015 the paper draws a picture of how the companies work with UX and usability in an agile development environment. We identify the challenges they are facing and if, and how the work progresses. We found that the UX maturity during these two years had changed significantly. This was revealed by the fact that almost all of the companies in 2015 had implemented or were in the process of developing a UX strategy together with more formalized UX processes. They also allocated more resources to conduct UX and usability work than earlier. We found that all of the companies made use of low-fi prototyping, followed by usability testing, workshops, personas, expert evaluations, user or customer journeys, customer visits and user task analyses. Almost all the companies carried out development using the Scrum framework. All of the companies were interested in the idea of agile UX, and found the idea of using the developers as a UX resource interesting. This, together with an idea of modifying existing usability methods to be used in an agile, industrial setting could be a solution to bridge the gap between academia and the industry.","","978-1-4673-7153-7","10.1109/Agile.2015.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284596","User Experience Design;Usability;Agile Development;Industry","Companies;Usability;Interviews;Industries;Testing;Hardware","program testing;software prototyping;user centred design","UX design;agile development processes;academic world;user experience;resource allocation;low-fi prototyping;usability testing;user journey;customer journey;customer visits;user task analyses;Scrum framework","","12","","49","","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This growing use derives the need to adjust agile methodologies to bigger, more complex system development projects, where architecture plays a significant role. However, many believe that an essential conflict exists between the requirement of minimalism in agile methods and the need for well-defined and documented architecture in complex systems. This paper presents an exploratory study aimed at understanding the software architecture related activities as perceived by architects with and without experience in agile methodologies. The findings indicate that while architects practicing only plan-driven methodologies perceive architecture activities as being related only to the first phases of the development process, architects involved in agile projects perceive architecture activities to be related to most or all phases of the development lifecycle. The latter perceptions are consistent with suggestions expressed in the literature regarding architecture in general and in agile methodologies in particular. Based on these findings we suggest that agile methods not only lead architects to adjust their behavior to the agile philosophy, but also improve architects' perceptions and practice of architecture in general.","","978-1-4673-1824-2","10.1109/CHASE.2012.6223022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6223022","software architecture;development methodologies;agile methodology;qualitative research","Computer architecture;Software architecture;Conferences;Software;Testing;Documentation;Programming","software architecture;software prototyping","plan-driven perceptions;agile methodologies;software architecture;human-centric software development process;complex system development projects;agile projects perceive architecture activities;agile philosophy","","6","","15","","25 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile software development is the most important approach that has spread through the world of software development over the past decade. Software team productivity measurement is essential in agile teams to increase the performance of software development. Due to the prevalence of agile methodologies and increasing competition of software development companies, software team productivity has become one of the crucial challenges for agile software companies and teams. Awareness of the level of team productivity can help them to achieve better estimation results on the time and cost of the projects. However, to measure software productivity, there is no definitive solution or approach whether in traditional and agile software development teams that lead to the occurrence of many problems in achieving a reliable definition of software productivity. Hence, this study aims to propose a statistical model to assess the team’s productivity in agile teams. A survey was conducted with forty software companies and measured the impact of six factors of the team on productivity in these companies. The results show that team effectiveness factors including inter-team relationship, quality conformance by the team, team vision, team leader, and requirements handled by the team had a significant impact on the team’s productivity. Moreover, the results also state that inter-team relations affect the most on software teams’ productivity.

Each of these methodologies prescribes a set of practices and techniques which are deemed appropriate for application in a specific context. However, there exists no single method which fits all project situations. This has resulted in the advent of Situational Method Engineering (SME) approaches, which are used for developing software methodologies that are tailored to fit the specific circumstances of the project situation at hand. Since tool support has become an essential prerequisite for widespread adoption of software engineering methods, provision of Computer-Aided Method Engineering (CAME) tools has become a priority. We provide a basis for the application of assembly-based situational method engineering to the development of bespoke agile methodologies. To this aim, a comprehensive set of relevant methodology features has first been identified, spanning the range of possible requirements that a method engineer may define for the agile methodology under development. Based on this set of requirements, a method base has been proposed that contains the method chunks necessary for satisfying these requirements. The proposed method base conforms to the Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM 2.0), and can be immediately plugged into CAME tools which implement this metamodel, including the Eclipse Process Framework Composer (EPFC).","1530-1362","978-1-4244-8831-5","10.1109/APSEC.2010.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5693209","agile software development methodology;situational method engineering;tool support;methodology requirement","Context;Crystals;Software;Programming;Communities;Project management;Planning","software prototyping;software tools","tool support;situational engineering;agile software development methodology;SME approaches;software methodology;software engineering methods;computer-aided method engineering;CAME tools;assembly-based situational method engineering;bespoke agile methodology;software process engineering metamodel;SPEM 2.0;eclipse process framework composer;EPFC","","9","","28","","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, understanding of how individual behaviour and productivity are affected by teamwork within an agile team becomes critical. Identifying factors that impact productivity will result in improvement of teamwork. Hence, a need emerges to recognise the significant ones. Doing so will enable project team management to determine the areas where to concentrate efforts in order to improve productivity. The objective of this research is to identify and analyse agile teamwork productivity influence factors by using system dynamics (SD) approach. Identification of main factors influencing productivity and how they impact agile teamwork are carried out through interviews, survey and literature review. From the perspective of agile team members, the four most perceived factors impacting on their productivity are team effectiveness, team management, motivation and customer satisfaction. Lack of agile team management support is found to be the most mentioned reason for failed agile project.

A systematic literature review conducted and matched with official documents, direct observation and correspondence, results in the identification of 25 factors grouped into 7 categories. The findings show that requirement changing, over-scooping, and communication become the main challenges in the case study. Agile best practice solutions were offered for each factor and challenge, along with a comparison view between the provider and government organization.

In an industrial setting, this makes it available to managers and customers. In the educational setting, it becomes possible to teach the techniques to novices before they have learned any programming.

However, very little is published on how this is achieved in real-life settings. This paper reports on results from a documentary study initiated to understand the agile-ready security practices that organizations use. We selected seven well-documented Security RE frameworks for Agile projects that have been used in practice and carried out a qualitative thematic analysis based on documents describing the frameworks and their supposed use in detail. This resulted in a list of solution practices that focus on introducing artefacts, organizational roles, competencies and activities in order to make sure that security RE is done systematically in agile project organizations. Our conclusion is that Security RE adds up to the documentation in an agile project, as teams introduce new story types, e.g. evil user stories, abuser stories, security stories. Plus, we found that Security RE relies on investments into the security training of the agile project teams and into organizing hack sessions. Last, if companies take security requirements seriously, it seems that they should consider ignoring the gatekeeping role of the agile product owner.","","978-1-5386-8412-2","10.1109/QuaRAP.2018.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8501269","","Security;Companies;Software;Requirements engineering;Computer science","computer crime;formal specification;organisational aspects;project management;software prototyping","agile product owner;security requirements engineering;software companies;agile project delivery models;agile-ready security practices;qualitative thematic analysis;agile project organizations;documentation;security stories;documented security RE frameworks;organizational roles;artefacts;evil user stories;abuser stories;hack sessions;gatekeeping role","","5","","17","","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile methodology is result of this rapid software demand and it is focusing on how to balance the ratio of developed software according to user demands. This research paper enlightens the agile methodologies and their conversion into the agile project management tools for ease as well as for rapid software development. This versatile use of agile project management tools systems has also posed new ways for analysis, planning and communication in software development. We reviewed current agile management tools on a set of parameters and compared to analyze systems merits and deficiencies. Based on our analysis, we have provided recommendations for error free rapid development. To support our recommendation we added a visual backlog in agile management tools which in return lessen the communication gap between developer and client. As our own future research work, we intend to study agile management tools from human computer interaction perspective.","","978-1-4799-7812-0","10.1109/ICOSST.2015.7396407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396407","Agile;Agile Alliance;Agile Management Tools;Backlog;Agile Methodologies;Descriptive Backlog;Visual Backlog","Software;Project management;Collaboration;Visualization;Testing;Planning","human computer interaction;software management;software prototyping","visual backlog;rapid software development;software engineering;software demand;agile project management tool;human computer interaction","","1","","19","","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Still, none of them specifically examined the dimensions of organizational culture, even though the previous survey and several studies have discovered it as an essential factor determining the ASD Project Success. Consequently, this research tries to identify how the organizational culture affects the success of ASD projects. This study aims to provide a new research model regarding organizational culture and project success in ASD and its validation. The validation process uses the Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The findings show that Rational Culture and Group Culture form positively impacts ASD Project Success. Meanwhile, Hierarchical Culture form negatively impacts the ASD Project Success.

"Quantitative planning and risk management of Agile Software Development","K.

While iterative and incremental approach of agile methodologies are the main attractions, at the same time they make estimation and predictability of agile software projects a challenge. Delivering workable software in short cycles helps with collecting more heuristic data as compared to traditional waterfall methodologies. Such data can be used as quantitative metrics for time and effort estimation that in turn can help with risk mitigation and risk avoidance. Although traditional agile formulations and recommendations place emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes and tools, this paper considers processes and tools essential in agile processes of today's complex software systems and distributed teams. Emphasis on processes and tools enables agile software projects to produce project metrics that can be effectively used in predictive analytics and risk management. The system that is introduced here emphasizes on quantitative approach to agile project planning and introduces a risk management model that produces risk metrics that are used to help with risk avoidance and risk mitigation. The risk metrics and the project simulation model are used to adjust project factors such as time, cost and scope during lifespan of project. Such adjustments come from recommender system that proposes changes to a wide range of project parameters for risk mitigation and risk avoidance.","","978-1-5090-1114-8","10.1109/TEMSCON.2017.7998362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7998362","","","recommender systems;risk management;software prototyping","risk management;quantitative planning;agile software development;software development industry;waterfall methodologies;complex software systems;agile software projects;agile project planning;recommender system","","10","","14","","3 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the use of the homeostatic approach, an agile method is created that ensures effective interaction between project stakeholders and prevents conflict situations. The paper describes the agile methods of organizing process-stochastic project management. First of all, groups of processes have been identified to create a project product and project management. In addition, a list of artifact groups for each group of processes was proposed. Also, a method for determining the success of the project is set forth. In order to determine the success of the project, a multi-criteria predicate was proposed, which contains a list of indicators for assessing the success of the project. Indicators have been developed according to the selected types of artifacts. For each indicator, conditions for achievement are defined according to its type. Apart from that, situations of success and absolute success of the project are introduced and the mathematical description of the achievement of each situation is provided. Not being limited to the list of methods and tools, the project manager can evaluate and select the necessary and sufficient tools to manage the innovative project. On the basis of the proposed methods, it is possible to develop tools for agile management of innovative projects within the process-stochastic project management system. The peculiarity of the proposed system is its openness to the implementation of new processes, methods and tools into the work of the system with a minimum risk of conflict situations from the stakeholders of the project.","","978-1-7281-0808-7","10.1109/STC-CSIT.2019.8929746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8929746","innovative project management;processstochastic management;homeostatic approach;project stakeholder management","Stakeholders;Project management;Tools;Homeostasis;Standards;Task analysis;Organizations","design engineering;groupware;organisational aspects;project management;stochastic processes","agile method;innovative project;project stakeholders;conflict situations;project product;project manager;agile management;process-stochastic project management system","","","","14","","12 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These practices are also adapted when introducing them to companies and their software development teams due to organizational constraints. As a consequence of the widespread use of agile methods, we notice a high variety of their elements: Practices, roles, and artifacts. This multitude of agile practices, artifacts, and roles results in an unsystematic mixture. It leads to several questions: When is a practice a practice, and when is it a method or technique? This paper presents the tree of agile elements, a taxonomy of agile methods, based on the literature and guidelines of widely used agile methods. We describe a taxonomy of agile methods using terms and concepts of software engineering, in particular software process models. We aim to enable agile elements to be delimited, which should help companies, agile teams, and the research community gain a basic understanding of the interrelationships and dependencies of individual components of agile methods.","","978-1-6654-4361-6","10.1109/CONISOFT52520.2021.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9653225","Agile method;agile software development;taxonomy","Technological innovation;Taxonomy;Companies;Software;Optimization;Software engineering;Guidelines","organisational aspects;project management;software development management;software process improvement;software prototyping","agile elements;agile teams;constant optimization;software development teams;organizational constraints;software engineering;software process models","","","","36","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, making sense of the manifold domains contributing to the success of an agile transformation, and orchestrating them with a great synergy is not a simple task. To navigate in this complexity and establish roadmaps, organizations primarily need to understand where they stand. There are a multitude of Agile Assessment Models (AAM) that are designed with the intent of identifying the state of an agile transformation in an organization. Designing an AAM is a valuable step towards this need, however, such models tend to lack vital aspects.

In recent years global software development (GSD) projects practice agile methods as prominent methods to deliver the software in increments with utmost user satisfaction and affordable cost. Beside the use of agile methods, the software industry has also considered the green aspect of software, to be in line with the demands of the organizations and the world technological ecosystem. The green and sustainable feature of software should focus both the energy and resource efficiency key factors. This phenomenon of embedding the green flavor in software has emerged a new research area, green software engineering, that promises the development of eco-friendly software with minimum energy and use of less computing resources, to trim down the adverse effects on both society and environment. The principal objective of this research study is to design and develop a multi-level Green-Agile Maturity Model (GAMM) to assess the GSD vendors' agile maturity in terms of green software development. The model has been built in four phases. In phase I and II, systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to identify the success factors and risk factors that either supports or hinders the green and sustainable software development respectively by practicing the agile methods in GSD. The results have been validated from 106 relevant experts, dealing with agile and green software projects, through questionnaire survey. The experts' demographic represents 25 different countries. We also identified the industry practices through SLR and survey, to address our identified critical factors. Phase III of this research deals with development of the GAMM by categorizing the identified factors into seven Green-Agile maturity levels. A similar approach has been used in other models such as Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), Implementation Maturity Model (IMM) and Software Outsourcing Vendors Readiness Model (SOVRM). In phase IV of this research, five case studies were conducted at GSD organizations, to evaluate the structure and efficacy of the GAMM, while as a major contribution, this paper presents our developed model, the GAMM, which aims to assess the green-agile maturity of the GSD vendors in terms of green and sustainable software development.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3079194","Qatar National Library, Doha, Qatar; QU Internal Grant Qatar University Internal(grant numbers:IRCC-2021-010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9427497","Agile software development;green and sustainable software;green-agile maturity model (GAMM);global software development (GSD);agile methods","Software;Green products;Organizations;Capability maturity model;Sustainable development;Computational modeling;Energy efficiency","Capability Maturity Model;DP industry;energy conservation;green computing;outsourcing;project management;software development management;software prototyping;software quality;sustainable development","green software development;sustainable software development;software development organizations;global software development projects;software industry;resource efficiency key factors;green software engineering;eco-friendly software;multilevel green-agile maturity model;agile software projects;green software projects;capability maturity model integration;implementation maturity model;software outsourcing vendors readiness model;evaluation framework;global software development vendors;energy efficiency key factors;GAMM;GSD vendor agile maturity;systematic literature review;SLR;CMMI;IMM;SOVRM","","1","","73","CCBY","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Third, given the fact that a product owner thinks in terms of the minimal marketable set of features in a just-in-time process, it is difficult for the development team to get a holistic view of the desired product or features. This experience report proposes U-SCRUM as a variant of the SCRUM methodology. Unlike typical SCRUM, where at best a team member is responsible for usability, U-SCRUM is based on our experience with having two product owners, one focused on usability and the other on the more conventional functions.

There is, however, less evidence on their usage among software practitioners in Malaysia. While the methods have become mainstream in other regions, that is not the case in this country. This paper empirically investigates the perceptions of Agile methods usage from seven organisations involving 14 software practitioners in Malaysia. Our participants are using Scrum and have a maximum of five years experience. We categorised our findings in terms of awareness, introduction, and challenges they are facing, together with the suggested and practiced solution from them. Interestingly, a change in mind set when practicing Agile was identified to be helpful in reducing the challenges. Lastly we present the practices in Agile they perceived to deliver the most benefits. We found that the use of Agile is still emerging in the country, and awareness is still lacking especially within the government sector. Although several challenges have been encountered when introducing Agile in their organisations, the benefits of Agile are reported to be in Agile practices such as: the involvement from all parties from the beginning, daily stand-up meeting, iterative and incremental, applying burn down chart, sprint and continuous integration. We aim to provide awareness and knowledge about Agile methods to the practitioners in the country and the nearby region.

For constant changes and successful delivery of projects the software project management techniques and framework were introduced. Currently many different process models exist which are selected and implemented according to the needs of project and organizations. To bring uniformity in project management processes PMI introduced Project management framework consisting of 10 knowledge areas and 5 processes. The framework consists of all aspects of the project management and processes which are required to be followed for the delivery of project from initiation of the project till the closure of the project. The other most popular software project management is Agile project management which emphasis on delivery in phases and releases known as sprints. The agile processes consist of Scrum, XP, Lean, Kanban, Crystal; Agile unified Process and many more. The agile process flow consists of six processes but the main lacking found in these processes was the unified framework to be followed by Agile Masters and Project managers. In this research, the Project management 10 knowledge areas and 5 processes have been mapped with the processes of Agile project management to propose Agile project management framework. A survey was also to get insight view of the individuals regarding agile project management and where the agile project management lacks focus in comparison with traditional project management. Agile Project management is an extensive and vast topic on which further research is required to be carried out to further polish these processes according the needs of the project.

Recent work suggests the use of agile processes since they promote shorter development cycles, better collaboration, and process flexibility. Due to the many benefits of agile processes, many software organizations have shifted to using more agile process methodologies. However, there is limited research that studies how agile processes affects the evolution of a software system over time. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to better understand the effects of using agile processes. We compare two open source projects, one of which uses a tailored agile process (i.e., Xtreme Programming) and another that has no formal process methodology. In particular, we compare the two projects within the context of Lehmans Laws for continuing growth, continuing change, increasing complexity, and conservation of familiarity. Our findings show that all four of the laws held true for the project that uses an agile process and that there are noticeable differences in the evolution of the two projects, many of which can be traced back to specific practices used by the agile team.","2375-5369","978-1-4799-2931-3","10.1109/WCRE.2013.6671304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671304","","Measurement;Complexity theory;Software;Evolution (biology);Libraries;Entropy;Programming","decision making;project management;public domain software;software development management;software prototyping;team working","project evolution;agile team;familiarity conservation;increasing complexity;continuing change;continuing growth;Xtreme Programming;open source project;software organization;process flexibility;collaboration;development cycle;agile process;process model;decision making;software management;software team leaders;nonagile projects;Lehman laws","","2","","24","","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) and LeSS Huge are also known and have lots of case studies in Japan, so enhancing LeSS and LeSS Huge framework is one of the well-developed ways to solve the organization's issues quickly. This paper aims to propose a new method, named Multi-Products Agile Method, based on LeSS Huge for developing multiple products in parallel at a large organization. We applied the proposed method to three products based in Japan. We had been tracking the velocity that is a total number of about 10 teams for one year. Our results prove that the proposed method is an effective way to scale agile organizations for multiple products. The method also makes it possible to use the knowledge and experiences of LeSS or LeSS Huge.

To do so, the collected 105 principles were content-analyzed in order to group them into 32 categories for a higher-level abstraction. These categories then were subsumed into two main categories. The whole grouping process was reviewed by one expert and the list was adjusted accordingly. Then, based on the consolidated list of the categorized principles, analysis and evaluations were made by the authors. As a part of the evaluations, semi-structured interviews with two experts were conducted to evaluate the categorized principles in general, especially in terms of their contribution to agility.","","978-83-955416-7-4","10.15439/2020F46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222861","agile mindset;agility;agile methods;agile frameworks;principles","Computer science;Systematics;Interviews;Information systems","software prototyping","agile mindset;agile methods;higher-level abstraction","","2","","43","","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect is the degree to which failure is accepted. Offshore development, while offering attractive hourly rates, has only exacerbated the problem. Failure is still the norm - it just costs less per hour! At the end of the day, software development has become synonymous with risk.

Solid experiences in combining CMMI with Scrum and story based development, has shown that the mix provides strong synergies (Sutherland et al., 2007) and insights into what CMMI practices fit and amplify the execution of Scrum and story based early testing development. This paper presents specifically how agile methods like Scrum are successfully combined with CMMI. CMMI provides solid support for what disciplines to consider. When applied the disciplines create a focus on important aspects of agile methods that perhaps are not normally elaborated, for example how to ensure a proper quality of a product backlog or how to ensure a proper ""production line"" for the project. This guidance may not be needed for small agile projects, but as the agile movement continues to grow, and is used for larger and more complex projects, agile projects will need to address these issues related to increased size and complexity. The experiences from combining CMMI and Scrum have led Systematic to identify examples of explicit guidance from CMMI that help to execute normal Scrum activities even better. These activities can be implemented in the spirit of the agile manifesto and principles and by doing so agile methods can be augmented and matured to ensure that even larger and more complex projects in the future can and will benefit from agile - with a twist of CMMI.","","978-0-7695-3321-6","10.1109/Agile.2008.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599479","CMMI;Lean;Scrum;story based development;test driven development","Planning;Risk management;Companies;Production;Organizations;Software;Inspection","Capability Maturity Model;program testing;software development management","mature agile;CMMI;Scrum;story based early testing development;agile projects","","26","","3","","15 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is because a good architecture assures that the system fulfils and will fulfil after future upgrades all required quality demands. In addition to the well-designed architecture, the development of such systems today requires agile methods, especially when it comes to the development of software. This is mostly to assure quality and fast innovations cycles reaching customers early and directly incorporating their feedback into the development process. In order to coordinate the work of many agile teams in large organizations, it is usually necessary to employ frameworks for scaling agile development. One such frameworks is SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) proven to work in many industries. Despite dedicating roles to the development of the system architecture at all organizational levels (e.g., System and Solution Architects), SAFe does not recognize the need for holistic architectural teams responsible for assuring that all architectural decisions are made in the best interest of the entire system. In this paper, we discuss the organization, responsibility and collaboration between such architecture teams - the Complete System Architects - and System/Solution Architects in SAFe. The results are based on the ongoing agile transformation at Volvo Cars based on SAFe.","","978-1-7281-1876-5","10.1109/ICSA-C.2019.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8712378","System Architecture;Agile Development;SAFe","Art;Automobiles;Systems architecture;Computer architecture;Organizations;Collaboration;Software","automobile industry;organisational aspects;project management;software architecture;software development management;software prototyping;team working","volvo cars;complex electrical systems;system fulfils;quality demands;agile methods;fast innovations cycles;agile teams;agile development;SAFe;holistic architectural teams;architectural decisions;architecture teams;Complete System Architects;agile transformation;agile system architecture","","1","","7","","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For software teams, productivity is a critical aspect that needs to be considered to ensure successful software development. Several factors can affect an agile software team's during the software evolution process. However, the literature review shows that there is a lack of empirical evidence to identify these critical factors and its effect on productivity in agile software development in terms of agile teams. The aim of this work is to distinguish these factors and to specify how agile teams can have a productive impact on the software. To accomplish this, we reviewed the relevant literature and administrated an online survey, which was administrated to 52 agile software development companies in Pakistan. The most commonly identified factors are team member and leader role, inter-team relationship, handling requirements, team velocity, conformance quality and team vision, as well as a number of host of sub-factors. The researcher used statistical techniques, such as Spearman's correlation, mean and standard deviation, to examine the results. The results showed that productivity correlates positively and significantly with most of the identified factors, except those with a negative correlation. The outcome revealed that these significant factors are critical factors to consider when examining team productivity in agile software development. The resulting quantitative analysis is expected to provide further insight into the dynamics of agile teamwork and establish a basis for further quantitative and qualitative modelling.","","978-1-5386-9509-8","10.1109/ICOMET.2019.8673413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8673413","Agile methodology;Software Productivity;Agile Software Teams;Pakistani Software Company","Software;Productivity;Agile software development;Companies;Teamwork;Testing","software development management;software prototyping;software quality;team working","agile software team;inter-team relationship;software productivity;software evolution;agile software development companies","","3","","43","","25 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research tries to study the current state of SMEs' project management in Saudi Arabia and to what extent they are applying agile methodologies. A survey of twenty-six enterprises with different sizes reveals that most of the SMEs are following the core concepts of agile methodology, despite that more than half of them are not aware of the agile concept and its best practices. This result leads that agile methodologies are suitable to be applied to SMEs in Saudi Arabia. However, there is a need to spread awareness and deliver solutions to these enterprises that help them in adapting the best available agile practices and tools.

However, acquiring the necessary skills and spirit is troublesome for many organizations as they rely heavily on a distinct mindset and experience that can only be acquired in the process. Literature indicates that serious games can help to bridge that gap. In this paper we take the example of agile project management methods to understand how games are applied to support the acquisition of agile and entrepreneurial capabilities. In an explorative study, we conducted qualitative interviews with game developers, business consultants, and agile coaches from nine different companies, and conducted desk research on available open source serious games. Based on 475 minutes of recorded audio, 81 pages of transcripts as well as 26 identified open source games, we discuss the purpose, characteristics, and success factors of serious games and their embedment in training. Further, we provide an analysis of available games and what capabilities they address. Based on our findings we advocate for a wider use of serious games and simulations to support the adoption of agile project and portfolio management capabilities in practice. In particular, we believe the benefits of such an approach allow participants to experience, understand, and be able to work effectively across the different interconnected components of such a capability.","","978-1-5386-1469-3","10.1109/ICE.2018.8436384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8436384","Agile project management;entrepreneurship;serious games;education;training","Games;Interviews;Portfolios;Organizations;Entrepreneurship;Encoding;Project management","computer games;investment;project management;software engineering","organizations;agile project management methods;agile capabilities;entrepreneurial capabilities;game developers;agile coaches;open source serious games;portfolio management capabilities;business consultants","","5","","38","","16 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We successfully scaled agile across a large development organization using strong, and very active, executive sponsorship to complement agile team discipline; by laying out a set of clearly defined, non- negotiable conventions and regulations, practices and expectations; and by training ourselves to constantly and consistently enforce, and question, these conventions from within.","","978-0-7695-3321-6","10.1109/Agile.2008.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599462","agile discipline;scaling;enterprise;executive sponsor","Organizations;Planning;Business;Production;Schedules;Standards;Testing","software engineering","agile development;engineering organization;agile team discipline","","2","","","","15 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the Scrum method appears to be on the verge of becoming a de-facto standard in the industry, leading the so called Agile movement. While there are success stories and recommendations, there is little scientifically valid evidence of the challenges in the adoption of Agile methods in general, and Scrum in particular. Little, if anything, is empirically known about the application and adoption of Scrum in a multi-team and multi-project situation. The authors carried out an ethnographically informed longitudinal case study in industrial settings and closely followed how the Scrum method was adopted in a 20-person department, working in a simultaneous multi-project R&D environment. Altogether 10 challenges pertinent to the case of multi-team multi-project Scrum adoption were identified in the study. The authors contend that these results carry great relevance for other industrial teams.

However, being “agile” is not trivial and only a few companies are capable of mastering so-called agile practices. Failure to apply the agile approach properly can do more harm than good and may jeopardize the benefits of an agile method. Thus, evaluating an organization's ability to apply agile practices using an agility assessment tool is critical. Aims: In this paper, we extend the metaphor of code smell and introduce the term agile smell to denote the issues and practices that may impair the adoption of the agile approach. The focus of the paper is defining and validating a catalogue of agile smells that can support agility assessment. Method: A literature review and a survey were conducted to identify and confirm the characterization of agile smells. Once identified, the agile smells were organized in a structured catalogue. Results: The literature review found 2376 references published between 2001 and 2018. We selected 55 papers for full consideration and identified 20 agile smells. The survey consulted 20 participants to determine the relevance of the selected agile smells. Conclusion: We have identified a set of 20 agile smells that were ranked according to their relevance. For each smell, we proposed at least one strategy to identify the smell's presence in real projects. The catalogue can be used by companies to support the assessment of their agility ability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2989106","Advanced High Performance Computing Center (NACAD/COPPE) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9072369","Agility assessment;agile development;agile smell","Software;Tools;Bibliographies;Companies;Industries;Crystals","project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","agile method;agile practices;agility assessment tool;agile approach;selected agile;agility ability;agile development;agile smells;Scrum;XP;crystal reports","","4","","117","CCBY","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the impending issues with regards to CTQ have led to rise of agile development methodologies in last couple of decades offering incremental & iterative development, customer collaboration and reduced time to market. The new agile paradigm, on the other side, is also bringing its own challenges and risks primarily in terms of runtime infrastructure cost, network accessibility and platform availability steering towards CTQ issues in a disguised manner. With Cloud Computing gaining popularity over the last few years offering almost zero CAPEX (Capital Expenditure), reduced OPEX (Operational Expenditure), high scalability & availability, it has been considered worthwhile to explore Agile based software development on Cloud. In this article, migration of Agile based project to Cloud has been discussed along with its benefits and challenges at both the stages.

Hence, it requires risk safety techniques to be implemented to mitigate the occurrence of risks. There is no standardized process for teams to deal with DAD risks. In this paper, a multi-agent reinforcement learning risk management model for distributed agile software projects is proposed. The proposed model is implemented to apply a dynamic policy. The model is applied as an experiment to definite numbers for a set of risk factors such as communication and coordination risk, project management risk, and SDLC risk. The proposed model is developed using multiple individual learning using the Q- learning algorithm. A DAD project with two projects is used to evaluate the proposed model. The proposed model was assessed and analyzed for its effectiveness.

The ability to manage and control the change elements on a project, particularly the project scope, is a key to project success. The notion of agile process was introduced to tackle the scope change-related challenges such as scope creep. By adopting an agile-footed process, the development organizations can react to the consistent market changes and client requests. However, continuous change accommodation may negatively impact on the success of the targeted project since the project manager mainly focuses on controlling scope change rather than analyzing its impact on the cost and quality. The agile-process advocates have accepted that this situation could happen even following agile methodology, which prompts on compromising the quality, postponed the plans, increases the cost, plan to modify, and diminished the consumer loyalty. Additionally, the scope-related challenge significantly increases, especially when managing scope creep in Global Software Development (GSD) context. Thus, there is a need to focus on scope creep factors in the context of AGSD. Motivated by this, current work aims at identifying the factors causing scope creep in the context of AGSD. To achieve the targeted objectives, we reported the current state-of-the-art related to existing scope creep models in AGSD context. We performed a systematic literature review and an empirical study to address the formulated research questions. The current study also identifies the additional challenges of scope creep from the industrial perspective. Based on the obtained results, the current work proposes a conceptual model for scope creep to assist the agile practitioners to effectively handle the scope creep, which ultimately increases the project success and forecasts change control effect on a software project. Moreover, the proposed conceptual model's effectiveness is validated through expert judgment and a case study. The obtained promising results ensure the additional aspects of AGSD; hence, the project manager could overcome the project's overall risk by implementing the proposed model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3100779","COMSATS Institute of Information Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499039","Scope creep;agile global software development;systematic literature review;scope management","Creep;Software;Systematics;Licenses;Stakeholders;Context modeling;Bibliographies","project management;software development management;software prototyping","scope creep;conceptual model;project manager;traditional software development projects;project scope;agile process;scope change-related challenges;agile-footed process;consistent market changes;continuous change accommodation;targeted project;agile-process advocates;scope-related challenge;software project;scope creep","","","","87","CCBY","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Center, Global Services, IBM, San Jose, CA, USA","2011 Annual SRII Global Conference","18 Jul 2011","2011","","","749","758","At the IBM Almaden Research Center, we have been working with other divisions of IBM, offering Software Development as a Service (SDaaS). We work with our colleagues to understand their business and pain points, and then leverage that knowledge to build an application that at least meets, but ideally exceeds their needs. In our experience, applications built in the mode of Software Development as a Service have the following characteristics. There is a single client that owns the program requirements, the requirements are not fully formed, and, the software is at least partly, if not completely, custom. With many decades of software development experience in our group, we have used many different techniques for conducting software projects. In SDaaS, the style of interaction between the client team and the development team is a natural fit for Agile Software Development methods. Although our conditions do not fit the ideal Agile Software Development project profile, we have consistently experienced significant gains from taking the approach of iterative and incremental development. We have used the Waterfall, or plan-based, method many times for past projects, and we have consistently paid a significant price for the ""Big Design Up Front"" problems that go with that type of schedule. Although agile methods have consistently outperformed other methods in the early stages of a project, they do less well as the application program grows and the project matures. Once an application is in production and has an established user base, the emphasis of the client and development teams change from fast, easy and elegant feature additions to stability, release planning and maintenance. The imposition of a fixed schedule naturally transitions the overall project management into a plan-based model. However, we came to realize that agile methods still play an essential role, even when the overall project has matured to a steady state and is managed in a plan-based fashion. When developing a new program requirement, unless it is completely understood (i.e. all aspects and expected results documented), then it must go through an agile prototyping phase in order for it to be properly developed and scheduled. That agile prototyping phase is still bound inside a plan-based schedule, but that leaves room for iteration and innovation that we would not otherwise have in a fixed schedule. In this paper, we examine the various forces that influence both the client and development organizations that are engaged in Software Development as a Service. Using several projects from our past as examples, we show that the level of program technology and requirement understanding determines which development method will be more successful. Plan-based methods will work if all aspects of the project are known and there are minimal variables. Otherwise, our experience shows that an Agile Development model is likely to be the best choice for the beginning of a project. Once a project reaches steady state, with production releases, then a hybrid model works best, where agile methods are used to prototype new features, but bounded inside of a plan-based schedule.","2166-0786","978-1-61284-415-2","10.1109/SRII.2011.82","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958156","Agile Development;Plan-based Development;Hybrid Development","Schedules;Programming;Software;Prototypes;Production;Pricing","project management;software development management;software prototyping","software development as a service;agile experiences;IBM Almaden research center;software projects;agile software development methods;big design up front problems;project management;plan based model;agile prototyping phase","","15","","25","","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So it is the main issue that we have to keep documentation or not in agile environment when we are developing under the agile methodology. Keeping the documentation where it is needed as simple as possible is the main goal of agile projects. But when we use an agile approach in more complex projects, it becomes more difficult to determine the need of documentation.

Research was focused on impacts within seven areas: Internal software documentation, Knowledge sharing, Project visibility, Pressure and stress, Coordination effectiveness, and Productivity. METHOD: Research was carried out as a multiple-case study on two contemporary, large-scale software development projects with different levels of agile adoption at Ericsson. Empirical data was collected through a survey of project members. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Intentional implementation of agile principles and practices were found to: correlate with a more balanced use of internal software documentation, contribute to knowledge sharing, correlate with increased project visibility and coordination effectiveness, reduce the need for other types of coordination mechanisms, and possibly increase productivity.

The rate of change poses a significant dilemma to stakeholders regarding the amount of effort and resources they should invest in methodological practices, including modeling, design, analysis, and specification. The attempt to move quickly from concept to operation often leads to preference of expedience for gaining early time-to-market over quality and robustness. Rather than referring to the modeling vs. agility challenge as a dilemma, we perceive it as an opportunity for synergy. Building on Object-Process Methodology (OPM)-the new ISO-19450 standard, we propose an agile model-based systems engineering (MBSE) framework that facilitates, and fosters development agility and system evolution. This agile MBSE framework extends the traditional scope of system modeling to cover aspects of functional and structural evolution, phase transition, deployment feedback, and configuration interdependence. We demonstrate the applicability of agile MBSE on a hypothetical ballistic missile defense system, based on publicly available information on Iron Dome - an Israeli ballistic missile defense system with proven operational capability.","","978-1-4799-5927-3","10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116855","Agile Model-Based Systems Engineering;Evolving System Models;Agile Development;Object-Process Methodology;Configuration Management;Ballistic Missile Defense","Modeling;Missiles;Iron;Unified modeling language;Planning;Biological system modeling","defence industry;ISO standards;military computing;missiles;systems engineering;time to market","agile modeling;object-process methodology;agile development;time-to-market;robustness;OPM;ISO-19450 standard;model-based systems engineering;MBSE;system modeling;iron dome;Israeli ballistic missile defense system","","8","","29","","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During the research stage, using the methodology proposed by Kitchenham, fifteen articles were analyzed and allowed us to rescue the strengths and identify the problems presented by the agile methodologies most used today. Then, the proposal was developed dividing it into three phases; each including events, artifacts, and tools to achieve your goal. Later, during the discussion, the proposal was contrasted with the methodologies initially analyzed and it was concluded that taking the points in favor of these and adding state-of-the-art technology focused on the well-being of the teams is synonymous with efficiency, meaning a possible change in the paradigm of the current world of work.","","978-1-6654-9973-6","10.1109/ICCI54321.2022.9756085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756085","agile project management;methodology;mental health;work teams;effectiveness","Mental health;Proposals;Informatics;Artificial intelligence","artificial intelligence;employee welfare;project management;software prototyping;team working","artificial intelligence;workers;work teams;agile methodologies;work efficiency;super-agile methodology;NEKO","","","","21","IEEE","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each year the public sector invests large amounts of money in the development and modifications of their software systems. These investments are not always successful and many public sector software projects fail to deliver the expected benefits. Goal. This study aims at reducing the waste of resources on failed software projects through better understanding of the success factors and challenges. Method. Thirty-five completed software projects in 11 organizations in the public sector of Norway were analyzed. For each project, representatives from the project owners, project management and the user organization were interviewed. Results. Small and large software projects reported different challenges, especially related to project priority. Taking advantage of agile practices such as flexible scope and frequent delivery increased the success rate of the projects. Projects with time and material contracts and involved clients during execution were more successful than other projects. The respondents experienced that extensive involvement and good competence of the client, high priority of the project, good dialogue between client and provider and appliance of agile practices were main success factors. Main challenges were related to technical issues, project planning and management, transition of the product to the user organization, involvement and competence of the client, and benefit management. Conclusions. Success factors tend to focus on human factors, e.g., involvement, competence and collaboration. Challenges focus on human factors as well as issues of technical nature. Both aspects need to be addressed to enable successful and avoid failed software projects. Competence, client involvement and benefit management are among factors that the public sector should focus on for realizing client benefits.","","978-1-5386-1589-8","10.1109/ICSE-C.2017.146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965362","software projects;success;empirical study;agile;contract type","Software;Organizations;Contracts;Project management;Investment;Planning;Stakeholders","human factors;organisational aspects;project management;software management;software prototyping","IT projects;success factors;software project empirical study;Norwegian public sector;software systems;Norway;project owners;project management;user organization;project priority;agile practices;extensive involvement;client competence;client-provider dialogue;technical issues;project material contracts;project planning;product transition;client involvement;benefit management;human factors","","11","","10","","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, there are no commonly accepted VGD best practices or frameworks that can bring together the complex and competing needs of software engineering and creative production. Although studios are reportedly using agile frameworks, the actual extent of application and effectiveness of agile practices in the VGD context is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to empirically determine how and why agile frameworks are applied in VGD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight New Zealand VGD studios. It was found that the agile frameworks, Scrum and Kanban, must often be adapted from their conventional use to meet the needs of different pipelines and delivery milestones within the phases of VGD. However, it seems that not all the needs of VGD can be met by current agile frameworks. Furthermore, inexperience with agile practices often leads to misunderstanding and misimplementing them in ways that seem to contribute to commonly experienced collaboration challenges.","","978-1-6654-1401-2","10.1109/ICSSP-ICGSE52873.2021.00019","University of Canterbury; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461025","Agile;Scrum;Kanban;Scrumban;Multidisciplinary Team Dynamics;Video Game;Game Development;Software Process Improvement","Training;Adaptation models;Pipelines;Collaboration;Games;Production;Software","computer games;entertainment;software development management;software engineering","New Zealand VGD studios;current agile frameworks;agile practices;video game development industry;video games;dominant entertainment industry worldwide;successful entertainment industry worldwide;video game development projects;commonly accepted VGD;software engineering;creative production;VGD context","","1","","50","","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is often thought that as traditional methods would be eventually replaced by new methods, it still remains the closest link to a naturally progressive route although the mind-set wants to get rid of the old and get in with the new. But it is not the replacement that is the variable to control. It has to be a dynamic approach which marries the two which is a hybrid methodology where a combination of the old and the new coexist. Interestingly a new strategy also seems to surface which looks at synergies and past pace scenarios, all within the realm of successful software project deliveries.

Moreover, as organizations continue to grow, they are facing large-scale global project challenges and complexity, leading to an urge to scale agile practices for better coordination. However, it has been surprising to find that approaches in the literature on scaling agile for large and global projects remain unclear. In addition, to identify and highlight which agile scales practices reported in studies on Agile GSD (AGSD) are related to SAFe practices, we conducted a systematic literature review. Besides, we mapped AGSD practices to the SAFe 5.0 framework to provide bases for those starting on such a journey. In our study, we found 24 articles related to the scaling of agile practices in a global environment, and 44 scaling agile practices that embrace 95 SAFe 5.0 components, including “agile coaching,” “agile architecture,” and “system demo”. This study provides an in-depth scientific investigation on how SAFe can be associated with global teams applying GSD.

Hybrid approaches of traditional and agile development promise combining the overview and predictability of long-term planning on an inter-team level with the flexibility and adaptability of agile development on a team level. It is currently unclear, however, why such hybrids often fail. Our case study within a large software development unit of 13 teams at a global enterprise software company explores how and why a combination of traditional planning on an inter-team level and agile development on a team level can result in ineffective coordination. Based on a variety of data, including interviews with scrum masters, product owners, architects and senior management, and using Grounded Theory data analysis procedures, we identify a lack of dependency awareness across development teams as a key explanation of ineffective coordination. Our findings show how a lack of dependency awareness emerges from misaligned planning activities of specification, prioritization, estimation and allocation between agile team and traditional inter-team levels and ultimately prevents effective coordination. Knowing about these issues, large-scale hybrid projects in similar contexts can try to better align their planning activities across levels to improve dependency awareness and in turn achieve more effective coordination.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2017.2730870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990187","Large-scale software development;agile;hybrid;inter-team coordination;dependency awareness;planning alignment;information systems development","Software;Planning;Agile software development;Companies;Task analysis;Interviews","data analysis;project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","large-scale software development;agile development;long-term planning;inter-team level;software development unit;global enterprise software company;ineffective coordination;agile team;large-scale hybrid projects;coordination challenges;planning misalignment;hybrid settings;effective inter-team coordination;pressing challenges;scrum masters;product owners;architects;senior management;grounded theory data analysis procedures","","48","","97","IEEE","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to properly manage IT related processes, several frameworks including ITIL (Information Technologies Infrastructure Library), COBIT (Control OBjectives for Information and related Technologies), IT Service CMMI (IT Service Capability Maturity Model) and many others have emerged in recent decades. Meanwhile, the prevalence of Agile methods has increased, posing the coexistence of Agile approach with different IT frameworks already adopted in organizations. More specifically, the pursuit of being agile in the area of digitalization pushes organizations to go for agile transformation while preserving full compliance to IT frameworks for the sake of their survival. The necessity for this coexistence, however, brings its own challenges and solutions for harmonizing the requirements of both parties. In this paper, we focus on harmonizing the requirements of COBIT and Scrum in a same organization, which is especially challenging when a full compliance to COBIT is expected. Therefore, this study aims to identifying the challenges of and possible solutions for the coexistence of Scrum and COBIT (version 4.1 in this case) in an organization, by considering two case studies: one from the literature and the case of Akbank delivered in this study. Thus, it extends the corresponding previous case study from two points: adds one more case study to enrich the results from the previous case study and provides more opportunity to make generalization by considering two independent cases.","","978-83-955416-7-4","10.15439/2020F47","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223001","agile;Scrum;information technology;COBIT;challenge;solution","Computer science;Process control;Organizations;Libraries;Information technology;Capability maturity model;Information systems","Capability Maturity Model;DP management;information technology;knowledge management;software development management;software prototyping","COBIT;scrum;Information Technology;complex domain;digitalization pushes organizations;agile transformation;corresponding previous case study;independent cases;agile approach;service capability maturity model;service CMMI;information technologies infrastructure library","","2","","41","","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To answer this question and design an agile roadmapping approach to support highly incremental planning done by startups, this article unfolded through a three-phase action research program that lasted 40 months and involved three startups and two startup accelerators. Typically, startups are not complex organizations but operate in turbulent markets—requiring constant changes in strategy, organization, and product decisions. Such an environment is notably adherent to the assumptions of agile methods, but not so to roadmapping, an approach typically tuned for larger companies. Thus, the DE context is explored to adapt the roadmapping approach to agile principles aiming at offering a nimble, living, and integrated process that can enhance business, product, and organizational decisions in startups. Finally, the resulting method helps to support 1) strategic to operational management by continuous planning of small teams dealing with constant changes; 2) better communication between investors, technical, and business members; 3) better absorption of roadmapping and its benefits by teams already proficient in agile approaches, and 4) better balance between plan and action in startups.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2020.3027918","Programa Institucional de Auxílio à Pesquisa de Docentes Recém-Contratados of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais(grant numbers:PRPq/UFMG 11/2017); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq(grant numbers:420126/2018-0); IEBT(grant numbers:23072.057271/2018-26); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247459","Agile methods;agile roadmapping;digital entrepreneurship (DE);roadmapping;startups","Entrepreneurship;Planning;Tools;Conferences;Software;Companies","business data processing;decision making;innovation management;organisational aspects;project management;strategic planning","product decisions;operational management;agile approaches;digital entrepreneurship;agile roadmapping approach;incremental planning;three-phase action research program;startup accelerators;complex organizations;DE context;organizational decision;strategic management;time 40.0 month","","","","65","IEEE","3 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is a mixed understanding of the possibility for their co-existence within an organization. Outside of the dogmatic debate regarding their co-existence, however, voices have been raised recently to recognize that both approaches have their merits, and perhaps, can be combined. This paper presents the results of an interview-based exploratory case study on the practices that an agile-by-design organization has put in place in order to profit from the opportunities that compliance to a quality standard can offer in respect to value creation for clients. Our conclusions are (i) that being compliant with a standard helps an agile company achieve client satisfaction, improved product quality and waste reduction; and (ii) that standards compliance does not necessarily impose significant changes on the agile process of an organization. Implication for practice is twofold: our results indicate (1) that agile organizations should strive for becoming more mature as this brings additional benefits, and (2) that for organizations to get standards-compliant there is a need of guidelines to direct them in complementing their agile processes with standards-compliant practices.","2151-1357","978-1-4799-2393-9","10.1109/RCIS.2014.6861054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6861054","agile software engineering;agile project management;standards compliance;empirical research method;exploratory case study","Synthetic aperture sonar","software prototyping;software quality;standards","value creation;agile projects;agile approach;maturity models;software quality;agile-by-design organization;quality standard;standards-compliant practices","","","","21","","21 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many aspects of agile methodologies can be regarded as standard practice but taken to an extreme. Consequently, although there are some agile practices that would have to be added to a traditional curriculum, there are many that are typically already covered to a limited extent.

However, little effort has been put into identifying common practices, which are being repeatedly, used to solve frequent problems in offshore development. In this research, we have studied from literature over 200 cases and have interviewed professionals participating in distributed offshore teams. Based on the observations, we have designed a solution known as Distributed Agile Patterns, which will address the common issues in offshoring scenario. Fifteen distributed agile patterns have been identified and classified into four categories based on the type of problem they solve. A reflection workshop was conducted where professionals were invited to review the pattern catalogue and help us verify and validate the catalogue. Based on their feedback, the catalogue was finalised.

Among the most popular is the framework of SCRUM (1986), which is characterized by iterations, where in each iteration it is necessary to make a planning, analysis of requirements, design, coding, tests and documentation. The requirements specification in SCRUM is based on the concept of user stories (US), which are the description of a requirement written in one or two sentences using the user's natural language. An important feature of US is that they must be estimable, that is to say, it must be possible to determine the time it will take to complete it. This allows the Scrum Development Team to determine the total time of the project. However in practice, this task still has problems due to the complexity of the requirements and affects the agreement of US in each iteration. In this paper we propose a strategy to classify the US following the taxonomy of Bloom to determine the degree of its complexity and by doing so make an agile estimation of the approximate time that each one requires for its realization. We show the results obtained after the US have been classified from two projects and based on them, we propose strategies to estimate them.","","978-1-5386-2652-8","10.1109/CSCI.2017.182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560942","Agile evaluation;User stories;Bloom's Taxonomy;Agile methodologies;SCRUM","Taxonomy;Complexity theory;Software engineering;Ontologies;Grammar;History;Iterative methods","formal specification;project management;software development management;software prototyping","agile evaluation;user stories;agile methodologies;software engineering methods;documentation;requirements specification;Scrum Development Team;agile estimation;Bloom taxonomy","","","","14","","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To support this trend and increase usability for agile project managers, the PMI (Project Management Institute) organization included agile practices and an agile guideline appendix in the latest release of its project management framework, PMBOK Sixth Edition. This paper evaluates whether or not some of the PMBOK processes are suited to Scrum-developed agile IT projects and agile culture by comparing all PMBOK knowledge areas and agile Scrum practices in a project phase-oriented matrix. This comparison identifies five areas where an agile approach, like iterative development and self-managing teams, could cause conflict with traditional PMBOK processes. Moreover, it highlights complementary processes as well as PMBOK processes which are not covered by agile practices at all.","2471-9269","978-1-7281-1117-9","10.1109/CINTI.2018.8928226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8928226","agile project management;PMBOK;Scrum;agile practices;agile;IT project management","Project management;Guidelines;Standards;Schedules;Organizations;Software","iterative methods;matrix algebra;project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","self-managing teams;agile project management;agile guideline appendix;project management framework;PMBOK knowledge areas;agile Scrum practices;project phase-oriented matrix;PMBOK 6<sup>th</sup> edition;project management institute organization;PMBOK sixth edition;Scrum-developed agile IT projects;iterative development","","3","","17","IEEE","9 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even after software companies following Agile framework methodology to develop their software's, many software's still fail to meet the requirements and eventually customers end up not using them. This is usually because the software teams fail to completely understand the user requirements. Agile framework and Design Thinking framework can be used together to gain customer empathy and to overcome this problem. This study discusses how Agile framework and Design Thinking supports the same principles and can be used to reduce software development failures. A Flashcard application was developed to validate Agile framework Design Thinking framework.

Productivity is a demand for improving organizational performance. ERP systems are a way to increase productivity. Therefore, ERP implementation is important to ensure that ERP runs well. Critical factors in ERP implementation must get serious attention to project management. Even so, the reality of ERP implementation is slowly, even tends to experience failure, resulting in highly expensive. The previous research that carried out ERP implementation showed that the failure reached 40%, and the achievement of the benefits of ERP implementation in Indonesia is still not optimal. It can be said that ERP implementation is a complexity project. For this reason, it is necessary to consider other implementation methods that can overcome the problem in implementing ERP. An agile method is a proactive and reactive alternative to handle the problem in implementing of ERP. The development of an agile ERP model is one way to achieve success in ERP implementation. This research methodology is a survey approach to the study of literature. This research will propose an agile ERP model which will be used as an effective guide for achieving the success of ERP implementation.","","978-1-7281-3333-1","10.1109/ICIMTech.2019.8843724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8843724","agile method;agile ERP model;ERP implementation","Project management;Software;Organizations;Information systems;Computer science;Industries","enterprise resource planning;organisational aspects;project management","agile ERP model;agile implementation model;industrial dynamics;productivity;organizational performance","","1","","26","","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Distributed development work comes with many challenges, especially related to communication and coordination. Thus, it is essential to also teach and prepare the new population of software engineers to be aware of - and familiar with - these hurdles. We addressed this need by arranging a joint (agile) software project course between universities in Finland and Norway. We had three teams - one with students from both countries and two with students from the Norwegian university only. The students were given a teacher mentor, a handbook on agile practices and state-of-the-art tools for project management and software development. Apart from monitoring the teams' progress, we also collected data from emails, questionnaires, student reports and interviews during and after the project. The main lesson learned is that the global and local teams are mostly facing the same challenges - especially when it comes to team building, clear project roles, and communication and management issues. Ultimately, our results show that the challenges were harder to solve by the global team and that not solving challenges in a timely manner had more serious consequences.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344101","global software development;agile;student teams","Software;Software engineering;Seminars;Project management;Buildings","computer aided instruction;distributed processing;educational courses;educational institutions;project management;software engineering;software houses","distributed software project course;agile methodologies;global software engineering;GSE;software industry;universities;Finland;Norway;project management;software development","","1","","21","","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In prior flagship-class orbiter missions, this process has been implemented using two approaches: activity plans are either systematically created from scratch for each orbit via a linear planning process, or future orbit plans are developed far in advance and carefully iterated upon to ensure maximum science return. These approaches have been effective, particularly for projects whose science observation strategies vary over the course of the mission, but require a number of operational constraints. Large team sizes, difficulty in relating detailed plans to qualitative science objectives, and the fragile nature of pre-planned activity sets allow limited opportunity for flexibility and optimization of plans during development. The baseline trajectory design for the Europa Clipper mission uses a suite of 45 low-altitude, short-period flybys of Europa at varying geometries to globally map the surface of the moon. In order to effectively integrate the activities of the spacecraft and its ten science instruments into a valid plan on the cadence necessitated by the trajectory design, mission operations engineers have developed a collaborative, agile uplink planning architecture. The foundational product of this planning architecture is the Reference Activity Plan (RAP), a full-mission activity plan that leverages the project's largely repeatable science observation patterns to create a template for planning at both strategic and tactical levels. Activities in the RAP are codified using a common schema and can be placed in the plan using constraint-based scheduling software that is driven by objective and quantifiable science measurement requirements. This approach enables dynamic modification of the whole mission plan in large or small segments, which allows planners to react to new science information or incorporate flight system performance characteristics into future orbit activities. The RAP also allows planners to understand the impact of their activity changes on the rest of the plan; since each subject matter expert has visibility into the entire set of planned activities, and the impact of their proposed changes upon the full plan is simulated, they can more effectively collaborate with the rest of the operations team to develop a conflict-free plan with less iteration. This paper examines unique operations considerations that drove the design of the Reference Activity Plan, the composition and proposed implementation of the RAP, and how the use of a single authoritative activity plan allows collaborative, flexible planning during uplink plan development.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-2734-7","10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172311","","","aerospace computing;astronomical instruments;planetary satellites;planning;scheduling;space vehicles","agile planning;NASA's Europa Clipper mission;Activity planning;planetary exploration missions;prior flagship-class orbiter missions;activity plans;linear planning process;future orbit plans;projects whose science observation strategies;detailed plans;qualitative science objectives;pre-planned activity sets;flexibility;valid plan;mission operations engineers;collaborative uplink planning architecture;agile uplink planning architecture;Reference Activity Plan;full-mission activity plan;mission plan;future orbit activities;activity changes;planned activities;conflict-free plan;single authoritative activity plan;flexible planning;uplink plan development","","1","","13","","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In agile, new features are introduced to the system in each sprint delivery, and although it may be well developed, the delivery failures are possible due to performance issues. By considering delivery timeline, moving for system scaling is common solution in such situations. But, how much system should be scaled? System scale requires current system benchmark status and expected system status. Benchmarking the production is a critical task, as it interrupts the live system. The new version should go through a load test to measure expected system status. The traditional load test methods are unable to identify production performance behavior due to simulated traffic patterns are highly deviated from production. To overcome those issues, this approach has extended CICD pipeline to have three automation phases named benchmark, load test and scaling. It minimizes the system interruption by using test bench approach when system benchmarking and it uses the production traffic for load testing which gives more accurate results. Once benchmark and load test phases are completed, system scaling can be evaluated. Initially, the pipeline was developed using Jenkins CI server, Git repository and Nexus repository with Ansible automation. Then GoReplay is used for traffic duplication from production to test bench environment. Nagios monitoring is used to analyze the system behavior in each phase and the result of test bench has proven that scaling is capable to handle the same load while changing the application software, but it doesn't optimize response time of application at significant level and it helps to reduce the risk of application deployment by integrating this three phase approach as CICD automation extended feature. Thereby the research provides effective way to manage Agile based CICD projects.","","978-1-5386-4417-1","10.1109/MERCon.2018.8421965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8421965","continuous integration;continuous delivery;agile project management;version management;configuration management","Production;Benchmark testing;Software;Tools;Automation;Pipelines","optimisation;pipeline processing;program testing;project management;public domain software;software prototyping","continuous delivery pipeline automation;agile software project management;agile features;sprint delivery;delivery failures;delivery timeline;system scaling;system scale;expected system status;live system;production performance behavior;CICD pipeline;system interruption;test bench approach;system benchmarking;production traffic;load testing;load test phases;system behavior;CICD automation extended feature;Agile based CICD projects;system benchmark status","","9","","26","","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This causes students to not apply theoretical process knowledge and therefore to not develop necessary skills associated with working with defined processes in the industry. Concretely, we report on our experience with teaching Scrum with Lego, removing formal grading requirements on the delivered product, emphasising process application in post-mortem reports, and organisational changes to support the process during supervision. These changes are analysed in the context of student satisfaction, teacher observations, and achievements of learning outcomes.

The principles behind agile development and the features of the Scrum methodology match up well with the expected outcomes of a major engineering design experience and preparation needed by students for engineering practice. This paper presents a case study on design team use of an agile process for the successful development and release on the Google Play store of an Android app for a client during the span of a two-semester senior design course in electrical and computer engineering. The agile project management used in the case study was found to be beneficial to all involved (students, mentors, and clients). It emphasizes behaviors that lead to greater satisfaction and higher quality results with the senior design experience. Student learning opportunities related to professional skills are examined.

The pressure to release high-quality, valuable software products at an increasingly faster rate is forcing software development organizations to adapt their development practices. Agile techniques began emerging in the mid-1990s in response to this pressure and to increased volatility of customer requirements and technical change. Theoretically, agile techniques seem to be the silver bullet for responding to these pressures on the software industry. Aims. This paper tracks the changing attitudes to agile adoption and techniques, within Microsoft, in one of the largest longitudinal surveys of its kind (2006-2012). Method. We collected the opinions of 1,969 agile and non-agile practitioners in five surveys over a six-year period. Results. The survey results reveal that despite intense market pressure, the growth of agile adoption at Microsoft is slower than would be expected. Additionally, no individual agile practice exhibited strong growth trends. We also found that while development practices of teams may be similar, some perceive and declare themselves to be following an agile methodology while others do not. Both agile and non-agile practitioners agree on the relative benefits and problem areas of agile techniques. Conclusions. We found no clear trends in practice adoption. Non-agile practitioners are less enamored of the benefits and more strongly in agreement with the problem areas. The ability for agile practices to be used by large-scale teams generally concerned all respondents, which may limit its future adoption.","1949-3789","978-0-7695-5056-5","10.1109/ESEM.2013.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681340","Agile;Agile development;Survey;Interviews","Software;Market research;Industries;Companies;Testing;Interviews","DP industry;software development management;software prototyping;team working","high-quality valuable software products;software development organizations;development practices;agile techniques;customer requirements;technical change;silver bullet;software industry;changing attitudes;agile adoption;Microsoft;market pressure;agile practice;agile methodology;large-scale teams","","39","","19","","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this model we apply Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions of the attributes required and identify the key attributes which have maximum correlation to the development cost; and then use constraint solving approach to satisfy the criteria imposed by agile manifesto. The proposed methodology is found to bet suitable for agile projects as it uses constraint programming to explicitly check for satisfaction of agile manifestos. On comparison with other approaches under research we find that our model provides a low MMRE value i.e.50.63. Our methodology can also be used in case of unavailability of historical data or expert opinion.

In this process, a methodology that is designed and developed to enable the development teams to plan the release commitments with minimum wastage is being highlighted. With this methodology, teams can plan the capacity requirements well in advance, provide commitments to the stakeholders, identify as well as compare the planned vs actual efforts so that the teams can retrospect on the impediments.

Univ. of Para, Belem, Brazil","2015 Agile Conference","1 Oct 2015","2015","","","50","59","Ward Cunningham in his experience report presented at the OOPSLA'92 conference introduced the metaphor of technical debt. This metaphor is related to immature, incomplete or inadequate artifacts in the software development cycle that cause higher costs and lower quality. A strategy for the technical debt management is still a challenge because its definition is not yet part of the software development process. Carolyn Seaman and Yuepu Guo proposed a technical debt management framework based on three stages. First, debts are identified and listed. After that, debts are measured by their payment efforts and then debts are selected to be considered in the software development cycle. This study evaluates the application of this framework in the real context of software projects adopting Scrum. Action research is conducted in two companies where their projects have significant technical debt. We performed three action research cycles based on the three stages of the framework for both companies. The main contribution of this paper is to provide real experiences and improvements for projects using Scrum and that may adopt the technical debt management framework proposed by Seaman and Guo. Both teams recognized that the proposed approach is feasible for being considered in the software development process after some modifications. Because of projects time constraints and ease of use, we reduced the use of the proposed metrics to two: Principal and the Current Amount of Interest. In consequence, decision-making was benefitted by the early consideration of the debts that really need to be paid. Instead of using probabilities to find the interest, these are registered every time the technical debt occurs. During the first phase, the debts identification was improved when all Scrum roles participated, while measurement and decision-making were improved when the team was responsible for these phases. The Product Owner role in both companies understood the importance of Technical Debt monitoring and prioritization during a development cycle. With these changes, the two teams mentioned they would remain using the resulting approach.","","978-1-4673-7153-7","10.1109/Agile.2015.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284597","Technical Debt;Scrum;Technical Debt Management","Software;Seminars;Companies;Visualization;Monitoring;Planning;Decision making","financial management;project management;software development management","technical debt management;software projects;Scrum;software development cycle;projects time constraints;technical debt monitoring","","6","","17","","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, existing cost estimation methods for agile developments used a story point. Because it is relative value, the estimation results tend to be easily fluctuated by the small variation of the baseline story point. For tracking project’s progress, the velocity was measured to check the progress and was used to make plan for the iteration and the releases of the project. The proposed method in this paper provides the systematic estimation and dynamic tracking methodology for agile projects. To estimate the effort of a project development, function points are used in addition to the story point. The function points are determined based on the user stories of desired features of the product. We adopt the Kalman filter algorithm for tracking project progress. The remaining function points at a certain point during the project are modeled as the state space model for the Kalman filter. The daily variation of the function point is observed and inputted to the Kalman Filter for providing concrete estimation and velocity.

Very little empirical evaluation of these proposals happened in real-life contexts. In turn, little is known about how agile developers understand security requirements and how they devise their coping strategies regarding these requirements. This position paper presents a qualitative analysis that sought to discover how agile practitioners reason about security requirements, what contextual factors they consider important for shaping the pro-cess of coping with security requirements in agile projects, and what these strategies are.

Literature suggests that functionality is the primary focus in Agile processes while non-functional requirements (NFRs) are either ignored or ill-defined. However, for software to be of good quality both functional requirements (FRs) and NFRs need to be taken into consideration; lack of attention to NFRs has been documented to be the cause of failure for many software projects. Hence special attention needs to be focused on NFRs in Agile software development. Requirements elicitation, implementation in design, development, and validation are important activities of software development. Agile has good processes to elicit functional requirements that are captured as user stories. However, NFRs elicitation has not been given enough attention within Agile processes. Additionally, reasoning and validating of NFRs have been lacking. This research proposes the “NERV Methodology: Nonfunctional Requirements Elicitation, Reasoning, and Validation in Agile Processes.” Current results show the artifacts developed in this research can potentially help software development organizations address NFRs in early Agile processes.","1558-058X","978-1-4673-7300-5","10.1109/SECON.2015.7133028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133028","Agile software development;functional requirements;non-functional requirements;NFR;Agile user stories;NFRusCOM;NFR Elicitation Taxonomy;NFR Reasoning Taxonomy;NFR Quantification Taxonomy;NERV Methodology;Scrum","Taxonomy;Computer architecture;Decision support systems;Guidelines","formal specification;software prototyping","NERV methodology;lightweight process;nonfunctional requirements;agile software development;NFR;functional requirements;FR;software projects","","10","","29","","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, can a team establish a localized velocity and then maintain or increase that velocity when distributing teams across continents. Since 2006, Xebia started projects with half Dutch and half Indian team members. After establishing localized hyperproductivity, they move the Indian members of the team to India and show increasing velocity with fully distributed teams. After running XP engineering practices inside many distributed Scrum projects, Xebia has systematically productized a model very similar to the SirsiDynix model (J.

The methodology for pair programming was performed in the university lab. The Scrum approach was performed in a Group projects for national level. We proposed two frameworks SIA and SEAM that uses the industry practiced models with the focus on pair programming and scrum in academics. Thus we propose two novel models named Scrum in Academia (SIA) and Software Engineering Agile Model (SEAM) in Academics while students engage in group projects as a team to get quality work to be submitted meeting deadline as if in industry.

Since agile methods suggest that priority should be customer/user's prerogative, taking all relevant factors becomes challenging without decision supporting tools. Our research question is the following: How can we formulate the agile release decision problem, and which computations can we do over requirements models to recommend solutions to that decision problem? Our contributions are the following: (i) we formulate this agile release decision problem as an optimization problem, (ii) we provide a modelling language to represent instances of this problem as requirements models, and (iii) we describe an online tool to make the models and solve the resulting optimization problem instances.","","978-1-5090-3694-3","10.1109/REW.2016.016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815599","requirements prioritization;requirements optimization;goal models;agile methodology","Planning;Optimization;Conferences;Government;Computational modeling;Postal services","formal specification;project management;software management;software prototyping","requirements optimization;requirements quality;agile projects;requirements priority rank;agile release decision problem;modelling language","","1","","15","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a difference between creating a Minimal Viable Product and a Minimal Marketable Product which leads to a balanced initial solution that can be a barebone implementation of a customer’s requirements that fulfills the minimum wishes of a customer. In this paper, we take a look at Usability principles, Agile methodologies, and Design Thinking to help development organizations realize the minimal features from a customer’s perspective without working towards fulfilling all the requirements given by the customer.

Using a qualitative research design and the Diffusion of Innovations Theory as a lens for analysis, we gained in-depth insights into factors influencing the acceptance of Scrum. Particularly, developers felt Scrum to be more compatible to their actual working practices. Moreover, they perceived the use of Scrum to deliver numerous relative advantages.

Therefore, the automotive industry is in need for technologies with high potential for automation and mass production. The innovative hairpin stator technology, in which the winding consists of solid copper bars instead of flexible round wires, promises unique and valuable characteristics on both the product and process side. However, major challenges need to be addressed and overcome to achieve a reliable and stable process for series production. Also, due to the cost-intensive and rather inflexible production lines, product and process characteristics need to be developed and defined at an early stage. One major challenge is the assurance of quality throughout the manufacturing process and especially the use of inspection technology in the course of the same. The goal is to develop an efficient inspection concept that specifically targets quality relevant interdependencies throughout the production process. Therefore, pre-identified highly influential process error sequences are analyzed based on learnings from early process development and expert knowledge regarding the respective process steps. Then, both potential inspection points in time as well as potential inspection technologies for the identified critical error sequences are evaluated. As a result, the analysis lists process errors and error sequences with critical impact on the quality of the finished hairpin stator and suggests inspection measures to address those parameters. In summary, this paper presents a method for the analysis of complex process chains in early process development and enables the integration of the results into the inspection planning for the pre-selection of the inspection point in time and technology.","","978-1-7281-8458-6","10.1109/EDPC51184.2020.9388194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9388194","electric motor production;electric motor production ramp-up;production process control;automotive quality requirements;inspection planning in agile process development;ex-ante process analysis;complex process chains","Wires;Windings;Process control;Stator windings;Production;Inspection;Planning","agile manufacturing;automobile industry;bars;copper;electric vehicles;inspection;manufacturing processes;mass production;power transmission (mechanical);production planning;quality control;stators","inspection measures;complex process chains;process development;inspection planning;inspection point;systematic approach;agile process development;hairpin stator production;electric vehicles;production capacities;electric powertrains;mass production;innovative hairpin stator technology;solid copper bars;series production;inflexible production lines;manufacturing process;production process;process error sequences;automotive industry;winding","","2","","14","","31 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To do that, agile methodologies are required in which there is a way to identify, from the beginning of the project, the Software requirements and its complexity to make an estimate of the time required for the development of the project. SCRUM, considered a framework, is among the agile methodologies most adopted by companies. The concept of Software requirement translated into SCRUM as User Stories (US). A crucial part for the success of the project is to estimate in each iteration the complexity and time that US requires to its realization. Obtaining this information from each user story allows the development team to estimate the total time that will be required to finish the project. In practice and since human resources need to be considered to meet the requirements of knowledge, experience and skills demanded by the user story for its achievement, this activity is still time consuming and generates poor estimates. In this work, we propose the use of a new version adapted from the Blooms taxonomy, coupled to the life cycle of the Software Development, seeking agilely to classify the complexity of US and to identify the stage in the life cycle of the Software Development to which it corresponds.","","978-1-5386-6577-0","10.1109/CONISOFT.2018.8645899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8645899","__Agile Software Development;User Stories;Bloom Taxonomy;Agile Methodologies;SCRUM","Taxonomy;Software;Complexity theory;Software engineering;Proposals;Scrum (Software development);Companies","project management;software prototyping","time consuming;Blooms taxonomy;agile classification;SCRUM;agile development;user story;development team;software development;user stories;software requirement","","2","","27","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The difficulty of adopting agile practices increases when there is a need to scale these practices. Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) has emerged as a solution to address some of these concerns. Despite few encouraging results of SAFe adoption, case studies indicate several challenges of SAFe adoption. Currently, there is a lack of a well-structured gradual approach for implementing and establishing SAFe. Before and during SAFe adoption, organizations require a uniform model for assessing the current state and progress, and for establishing a roadmap for the initiative. To address this need, we developed a maturity model for adopting agile and SAFe practices. Taking an existing agile maturity model as the basis, we extended the model with practices that are key to scaling agile practices for the SAFe. The model is developed and refined using a Delphi study. Subsequently, a case study was conducted in a large organization where the model was applied to assess the maturity level of the organization in adopting SAFe.","2376-9505","978-1-4673-7585-6","10.1109/SEAA.2015.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7302487","Agile software development;scaled agile framework;SAFe;maturity model;Delphi study","Organizations;Software;Planning;Collaboration;Industries;Portfolios;Testing","Capability Maturity Model;software prototyping","agile software development scaling;agile practices;scaled agile framework;SAFe practices;agile maturity model;Delphi study;organization maturity level;SAFe maturity model","","17","","25","","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, constant feedback on different levels is considered to be of high importance. With constant feedback, transparency goes hand-in-hand. Compared to traditional software development, Agile approaches have much higher transparency, and this might be a problem for some people. What does it feel like to work in such an Agile team or organization for the individual? How do the software developers, testers or other team members experience this environment of high transparency and continuous feedback? In this paper we focus on a subset of the third Swiss Agile Study from 2016, a nationwide survey about software development, to shed some light on the sociological, cultural and cognitive aspects of Agile teams and their individual member. We found that despite the increased transparency, the majority of the participants reported working in an Agile environment, both on the individual and on the team level, as positive and satisfying.

Malaysian Software Engineering Conference (MySEC)","18 Dec 2014","2014","","","222","227","A significant number of software development methods have been published over the last 40 years that purport to be properly based on empirical, adaptive and collaborative development. All suggest, some by name, rapid development; bringing systems to production rapidly and at lower cost. The latest manifestation of these methods is Agile Development. This paper pursues the idea that in normal, everyday life people inevitably and invariably behave in this manner; empirical, adaptive and collaborative. Their behaviour is entirely based on empirical observation of the immediate circumstances and conditions, they adapt their behaviour according to these empirical observations, and they usually need to and indeed do, collaborate with others to achieve their ends. This thinking appears to be well supported in management literature, and by influential thinkers, historically. The thesis is also that every activity that people undertake can be reasonably defined as a project. Everyday activities such as going to work, visiting the supermarket, having dinner in a restaurant with friends are examples of the myriad activities undertaken by individuals, groups and families in the natural course of their lives. To achieve success in even these usual and commonplace activities requires planning, and the activities are carried out using empirical experience to adapt their behaviour as necessary, and is almost always done in cooperation and collaboration with others. The question must arise as to why Agile Development of computer software systems is still considered as a secondary, probably second-rate and even damaging and unworkable approach to software development when these development approaches are so embedded with ideas of empirical planning, adaptive project management and collaborative behaviour. They're only natural!","","978-1-4799-5439-1","10.1109/MySec.2014.6986018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986018","agile development;adaptive planning;empirical project management","Planning;Educational institutions;Project management;Software;Collaboration","project management;software development management;software prototyping","collaborative behaviour;adaptive project management;empirical planning;software development;computer software systems;agile development","","1","","16","","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Enterprise architecture (EA) can provide such coherence. Combining the scaling agile methods with EA is challenging. However, such a combination could benefit from the flexibility that agile approaches offer and provide the consistency and long-term focus that EA pursues. This article uses the longitudinal case study research to explore how organizations can effectively govern Agile and EA in large-scale agile transformations. Our case analysis shows that methods for scaling Agile do not provide sufficient guidance to properly handle the transformation from existing EA practices to an Agile EA combination company-wide. We propose how EA can be applied effectively in large-scale agile transformations despite the two seemingly conflicting approaches of Agile and EA. Based on our findings, we propose a conceptual model for future research that incorporates factors that take EA into account in the governance of agile-scaling frameworks.

The goal of this paper is to investigate the challenges facing adoption of threat modeling using the Microsoft approach with STRIDE. We performed a case study in a company comprising five agile development projects. We identified 21 challenges to threat modeling that emerged from our observations. We then mapped these challenges to challenges found in the literature. Some challenges overlap the findings from the literature; the extra challenges we have found in our exploratory study came mostly from the activities of asset identification and also from our observations on what happened after the threat modeling meetings.

Although Scrum presents several advantages such as incremental deliveries at the end of each sprint, stakeholders and product owners can change the requirements during the process and Scrum can adapt very quickly to these changes. Process and final product quality continue to be Scrum’s main challenges. Several authors have attempted to improve the quality of Scrum projects, changing some aspects of the framework such as including new quality practices, a quality role, as well as quality processes. However, the quantification of quality is still a challenge. This study suggests a change to Scrum including a quality role and some artifacts to evaluate quality before, during, and after each sprint. The proposed framework, called Scrumlity, was used for several weeks in real projects; Tests were conducted after each sprint to evaluate the acceptance rating for this new framework.

This paper describes the preparatory work done towards analysing the literature pertaining to the transition of organisations to swift methods from heavy-weight techniques, along end goal being a well-planned and well-organized review. A preliminary review provided in the existing literature suggests that organisations usually begin the transformation with formalized coaching, guidance sessions and documentation to introduce developers to agile methods, which often start as pilot projects with a small number of teams. Organisations attempting the transition face a variety of challenges - from bureaucratic processes that are not conducive to agile methods, to managerial systems that do not support an agile way of working. Existing literature reviews attempt to analyse a set of specific issues in the agile transformation process, or focus on primary studies on certain time limit and certain limit of agile method/integration of agile with other frameworks, limiting the scope of these studies. The research questions, and the inclusion criteria, and the search strategy used for selecting relevant papers are described.","","978-1-7281-5371-1","10.1109/ICCES48766.2020.9137917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9137917","software development methods;agile methods;transition approaches;benefits and challenges;systematic literature review","Systematics;Limiting;Bibliographies;Documentation;Search problems;Software;Faces","project management;software development management;software prototyping","plan-driven methods;systematic literature review;agile methods;organisations;agile transformation process;software development projects","","","","39","","10 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of spikes in agile software development (ASD) can enable organizations to produce quality software by employing the required technical expertise, planning the entire development cycle and ensuring that the client's requirements are adhered to. This study aims to examine the use of spikes in ASD. It explores the role, efficiency and efficacy of spikes in various software development domains through the different agile methods. An exploratory research design is adopted to achieve this purpose, whereby mixed methods are used to collect concurrently both qualitative and quantitative data from the experts recruited to the study. Through the survey, it establishes that the primary role of spikes is risk management through investigations to understand user stories and reveal any uncertainty. Conclusively, the study findings imply that spikes have become an essential tool for most agile teams in ASD. The efficiency and effectiveness that are reported show that the majority of experts in software development have realized the value of using spikes in their processes.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458126","Agile;spikes;prototype;risk management;uncertainty","Uncertainty;Scientific computing;Agile software development;Organizations;Tools;Software;Planning","software development management;software prototyping;software quality","agile software development;agile development cycle;user story;ASD;quality software;software development domains;agile teams;spikes;risk management","","","","20","","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile principles emphasize building working software that people can get hands on quickly, versus spending a lot of time writing specifications up front. Agile development focuses on cross-functional teams empowered to make decisions, versus big hierarchies and splitting by function. It also focuses on rapid iteration, with continuous customer input along the way. This paper deals with Agile methodology and scaling.

There are many flavors of agile methodologies available today. Organizations can choose them according to their needs. These methodologies include Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) and others. Agile methods especially target functional aspects of the software to be built, quality is their second priority. Software Quality is one of the major concerns for software organizations now a days. Reusability, on the other hand, is also important in terms of reducing cost to market, less time consumption in development and increased software productivity. Agile methods put a very little emphasis on these two highlighted points.

To truly leverage the power of Agile, big organizations need to be able to utilize distributed teams effectively. However, Agile delivery relies hugely on collaboration among team members and this can become a stumbling block among such geographically dispersed teams. Moreover, in such large projects the development and process layer needs to be monitored for any problematic patterns or events that could potentially cause the Sprints to fail. Here, we describe an automated approach which allows for contextual collaboration in such distributed Agile projects. The approach captures important events from the process and the development environment and uses a rule based approach to then automatically create awareness regarding them to appropriate roles in the project. Every team member receives an actionable feed in a MyContext pane which then leads the team member to navigate to an Activity centric context where collaboration specific to that activity can take place. This approach has been implemented in a process guidance and awareness workbench that we are piloting within our organization.","","978-1-4673-9775-9","10.1109/ASEW.2015.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7426640","Distributed Agile;Contextual Collaboration","Collaboration;Context;Stakeholders;Organizations;Electronic mail;Feeds;Planning","software prototyping","automated contextual collaboration approach;distributed Agile projects;MyContext pane;activity centric context","","2","","12","","7 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Implementing the same agile philosophy but with an increase of complexity, i.e., large-scale agile (LSA) development, are sometimes criticized of not being as effective as typical ASD, requiring additional concerns and the need to address new research challenges. This PhD research proposes an approach for embedding architecture design in agile development, first in early analysis and then during the iterations and by properly providing the mechanisms to deal with the changes in requirements. The main result is a method for adopting logical architectures, Four-Step-Rule-Set (4SRS), properly adapted to ASD contexts, to be used as complementary approaches to an ASD lifecycle, so that ASD teams can use that information as input for delivering the working software.","","978-1-5090-3581-6","10.1109/QUATIC.2016.059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814556","software logical architectures;architecture design;agile development;large-scale agile","Computer architecture;Software;Unified modeling language;Planning;Software architecture;Context;Documentation","software architecture;software prototyping","logical architecture;agile software development;ASD;LSA development;large-scale agile development;four-step-rule-set architecture;4SRS architecture","","","","36","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software projects have evolved through a number of development models over the last few decades. Hence, to cover an accurate measurement of the effort and cost for different software projects based on different development models having new and innovative phases of software development, is a crucial task to be done. An accurate prediction always leads to a successful software project within the budget with no delay, but any percentage of misconduct in the overall effort and cost estimate may lead to a project failure in terms of delivery time, budget or features. Software industries have adopted various development models based on the project requirements and organization's capabilities. Due to adaptability to changes in a software project, agile software development model has become a much successful and popular framework for development over the last decade. The customer is involved as an active participant in the development using an agile framework. Hence, changes can occur at any phase of development and they can be dynamic in nature. That is why an accurate prediction of effort and cost of such projects is a crucial task to be done as the complexity of overall development structure is increased with the time. Soft computing techniques have proven that they are one of the best problem solving techniques in such scenarios. Such techniques are more flexible and presence of bio-intelligence increases their accuracy. Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS), etc. are applied successfully for estimation of cost and effort of agile based software projects. This paper deals with such soft computing techniques and provides a detailed and analytical overview of such methods. It also provides the future scope and possibilities to explore such techniques on the basis of survey provided by this paper.","2375-5822","978-1-5090-0451-5","10.1109/CINE.2016.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556814","Agile software development;neural network;cost estimation;effort estimation;soft computing;software project management (SPM)","Software;Estimation;Agile software development;Artificial neural networks;Computational modeling;Predictive models","fuzzy logic;neural nets;project management;software cost estimation;software development management;software prototyping;uncertainty handling","software cost estimation;software project;agile software development model;soft computing techniques","","15","","68","","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As software engineering requires not only technical, but also inter- and intrapersonal skills, these skills should also be assessed. Assessing soft skills is challenging, especially when project-based and experiential learning are the primary pedagogical approaches. Previous work suggests that including students in the assessment process can yield a more complete picture of student performance. This paper presents experiences with developing and using a peer assessment framework that provides a 360-degree view on students' project performance. Our framework has been explicitly constructed to accommodate and evaluate tacit skills that are relevant in agile software development. The framework has been evaluated with 18 bachelors- and 11 masters-level capstone projects, totaling 176 students working in self-organized teams. We found that the framework eases teacher workload and allows a more thorough assessment of students' skills. We suggest including self- and peer assessment into software capstone projects alongside other, more traditional schemes like productivity metrics, and discuss challenges and opportunities in defining learning goals for tacit and social skills.","2377-634X","978-1-4673-5261-1","10.1109/FIE.2013.6685132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6685132","Peer assessment;assessment metrics;self-assessment;case study;capstone project;experiential learning;project-based learning;tacit skills;teamwork;computer science education;agile software engineering","Software;Software engineering;Teamwork;Production facilities;Correlation;Educational institutions","computer science education;software prototyping","explicit skills assessment;tacit skills assessment;agile software engineering capstone projects;higher-education institutions;working life;intrapersonal skills;interpersonal skills;technical skills;project-based learning;experiential learning;pedagogical approaches;student performance;peer assessment framework;agile software development;masters-level capstone projects;bachelors-level capstone projects;self-organized teams;self assessment;social skills","","10","","31","","19 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the iterative nature of agile development, the integration of software architecture into the agile way has become challenging. This research identifies the challenges of having a robust architecture in projects already executed by plan driven methods and new projects likewise by conducting a literature review and a case study analysis. The ensuing analysis finds that there are three major areas: people, process and technology, in which these challenges could be mapped.","","978-989-758-143-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320357","Agile;Waterfall;Plan Driven Methods;Software Architecture;Software Development;Requirements Engineering;Software Development Life Cycle","Software architecture;Variable speed drives;Software;Computer architecture;Requirements engineering;Agile software development;Bibliographies","","","","","","14","","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is essential that graduates of such programs seeking careers in industry understand and have positive attitudes toward agile principles. With this knowledge they can participate in agile teams and apply these methods with minimal additional training. However, learning these methods takes experience and practice, both of which are difficult to achieve in a direct manner within the constraints of an academic program. This paper presents a novel, immersive boot camp approach to learning agile software engineering concepts with LEGO® bricks as the medium. Students construct a physical product while inductively learning the basic principles of agile methods. The LEGO®-based approach allows for multiple iterations in an active learning environment. In each iteration, students inductively learn agile concepts through their experiences and mistakes. Subsequent iterations then ground these concepts, visibly leading to an effective process. We assessed this approach using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Our assessment shows that the students demonstrated positive attitudes toward the boot-camp approach compared to lecture-based instruction. However, the agile boot camp did not have an effect on the students' recall on class tests when compared to their recall of concepts taught in lecture-based instruction.","2377-634X","978-1-61284-469-5","10.1109/FIE.2011.6142849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142849","Active learning;Agile concepts;Software engineering education;Workshops","Conferences;Education;Business;Programming;Software engineering;Cities and towns;Industries","computer science education;software engineering","agile boot camp;LEGO-based active game;ground agile development principles;industry-practiced agile methods;software engineering curriculum;academic program;multiple iterations;active learning environment;quantitative methods;qualitative methods;lecture-based instruction","","18","","12","","2 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both the quality of the resulting software and the performance of the team require feedback. The performance of the team developments is often addressed in retrospectives which are not only part of the SCRUM framework, but also in general. Reflecting on incidents during the last sprint helps the team to increase performances, expressed by, e.g., efficiency and productivity. However, it is not only essential to identify volatile sprint performances, but also to characterize the primary cause to solve them. Main reasons for low performance are often not visible, primarily when they are related to social-driven team behavior, such as communication structures, mood, or satisfaction. In this paper, we analyze whether automated team feedback about retrospective sprint-behavior can help the team to increase performances due to additional awareness about the dynamic effects over time. In a comparative case study with 15 software projects and a total of 130 undergraduate students, we investigated the sustainable impact of feedback on human aspects. Our results indicate that automated feedback positively affects team performances - and customer satisfaction.","","978-1-7281-3393-5","10.1109/ICSSP.2019.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812840","team dynamics, agile, retrospectives, pro-active feedback, information transparency","Software;Productivity;Data visualization;Human factors;Software engineering;Task analysis;Industries","customer satisfaction;feedback;project management;software development management;software maintenance;software prototyping;software quality;team working","agile development;agile software development teams;continuous feedback;team developments;volatile sprint performances;social-driven team behavior;automated team feedback;retrospective sprint-behavior;software projects;SCRUM framework","","6","","29","","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile methods can achieve a high level of satisfaction among all project stakeholders (users, customers, business managers, developers, and project managers) in terms of productivity, product quality, cost containment, time-to-market, and overall morale. Success with agile requires focus on requirements and design as a continuous discovery process, posing challenges for practitioners of more traditional project management both in terms of method adoption and sustained commitment. Thriving Systems Theory clarifies the appeal of agile project structure and processes, helps project teams determine and achieve the optimal portfolio of quality characteristics, and better articulate their value to all stakeholders. Thriving Systems Theory is an emerging framework of systems design quality that translates the research of design pattern patriarch Christopher Alexander on physical architecture design quality into the domain of systems engineering. The satisfaction achieved through agile methods is explained by Thriving Systems Theory's fifteen choice properties of systems design quality. We demonstrate by identifying the manifestation of the choice properties in SCRUM, an exemplar of agile software project management.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-4525-7","10.1109/HICSS.2012.513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6149493","agile methods;architecture;software development;project management;design quality","Project management;Computer architecture;Software;Buildings;Planning;Architecture;Encapsulation","software architecture;software prototyping","SCRUM project architecture;thriving systems theory;agile project management;project stakeholders;agile project structure;agile project process;optimal portfolio","","2","","14","","9 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The primary objective of this paper is to use machine learning to develop predictive models for Scrum adoption, identifying a preliminary model with the highest prediction accuracy. The machine learning models were implemented using multiple linear regression statistical techniques. In particular, a full feature set adoption model, a transformed logarithmic adoption model, and a transformed logarithmic with omitted features adoption model were evaluated for prediction accuracy. Future research could improve upon these findings by incorporating additional model evaluation and validation techniques.","","978-83-955416-7-4","10.15439/2020F214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222987","Adoption;Agile methodologies;Machine learning;Scrum","Measurement;Training;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Data models","learning (artificial intelligence);project management;regression analysis;software development management;software metrics;software prototyping","Agile software development methodologies;Scrum framework;software projects;Waterfall methodology;predictive models;Scrum adoption;machine learning models;multiple linear regression statistical techniques;transformed logarithmic adoption model;validation techniques;full feature set adoption model","","2","","24","","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional development methodologies are too cumbersome to meet the rapidly changing requirements and short product cycles demanded by business. To meet these changing requirements, software developers have developed agile software development methodologies (SDMs) utilizing iterative development, prototyping, and templates. This research project investigated agile SDM implementation using an online survey sent to practitioners worldwide. This survey data were used to identify factors related to agile SDM implementation. Factors that included training, management involvement, access to external resources, and corporate size were found to impact implementation of an agile software development methodology. Factors such as using models, having an implementation plan, collocating the development team, and developing software for Internet or intranet use did not impact the implementation of an agile software development methodology. Several of the factors that impact the implementation of an agile development methodology are under the control of management. Organizations considering the implementation of an agile methodology may wish to manipulate some of these factors to increase the opportunities for success of their methodology.","1558-058X","1-4244-1028-2","10.1109/SECON.2007.342860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147390","","Programming;Internet;Resource management;Software engineering;Management training;Testing;Educational institutions;Iterative methods;Software prototyping;Software development management","Internet;intranets;software engineering","agile software development;Internet economy;software engineering;agile methodology implementation;Crystal methods;XP;extreme programming;intranet implementation","","22","","12","","23 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As such the management decision as to which stories to develop and which to ignore can be an extremely difficult one requiring an expert balancing of competing benefits and risks. This paper proposes a relatively simple statistical methodology that allows for the uncertainty in story size, value and project velocity. In so doing it provides key stakeholders with the opportunity to manage uncertainty in the planning of future releases.

Agile Software Development (ASD) encourages the delivery of working software frequently; however, there are many factors that affect productivity in that context. The objective of this paper is to analyze the research works about productivity in ASD to identify: the factors that affect productivity, the most used research methods, the most studied productivity levels, the concepts related to productivity, the most studied agile methodologies, and the use of productivity metrics in ASD. To perform such analysis, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) in which we included 25 primary studies. As result of the SMS, we identified the main factors that affect productivity in ASD and the context in which the included primary studies were performed. We found that Case Study was the most used research method, and interviews and questionnaires are widely used as data collection methods. We found that most of the reported factors affecting productivity in ASD are related to agile teams, and although quality should be related to productivity, it was not considered in all studies.","","978-1-5386-3956-6","10.1109/CONISOFT.2017.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8337934","productivity;performance;Agile Software Development","Productivity;Software;Data mining;Quality assessment;Measurement;Customer satisfaction;Agile software development","software development management;software metrics;software prototyping","agile Software Development;Systematic Mapping Study;Agile Software Development;ASD;productivity metrics;productivity levels;agile methodologies;SMS","","4","","16","","16 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Implementing these principles supports developers to react to challenges such as shortened innovation cycles. For successful implementation and use of these new principles, support functions such as procurement have to be adapted to the demands of flexible, agile and accelerated processes. Complexity of tasks and impact on corporate success of procurement increased significantly in the last decades resulting in specialized stand-alone procurement departments. Being optimized for traditional development methods such as stage-gate, these departments will be challenged by agile developers demanding for highly flexible, hardly predictable procurement activities. Therefore, the authors present a scientifically derived catalog of requirements for procurement in agile product and technology development projects, e.g. shortened lead times and vague technical specification of products to be procured. Based on this catalog, options for the configuration of procurement in agile development projects, such as the organizational merging of development and procurement, are discussed. Adapting the procurement according to the requirements derived in this paper will help companies to successfully conduct procurement activities in regard to the needs of agile new product development.","","978-1-5090-3595-3","10.1109/PICMET.2016.7806809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806809","","Technology management;Technological innovation;Product development;Procurement;Agile software development;Testing","agile manufacturing;innovation management;procurement;product design;product development;software prototyping","next generation hardware development;project-specific designs;corporate success;procurement departments;procurement activities;technology development projects;agile new product development","","2","","37","","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, conventional agile development still faces many problems under rapid iterations. Frequent iteration lacks efficient communication a large community, resources to share information, and quality of product. For better project management, this article describes a method, called the design-informing model (DIM), to improve the agile development. The design-informing model consists of four parts, user mental mode, developer mental model, system model, and environmental model. At the end of the paper, some discussions will be conducted to evaluate DIM in practice.","","978-1-7281-7106-7","10.1109/CDS49703.2020.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9275950","project management;agile development;software engineering;model optimization","Data science","iterative methods;knowledge based systems;software prototyping","environmental model;design-informing model;project management models;Waterfall model;V model;conventional agile development;developer mental model;system model","","","","15","","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The analysis showed that despite the widespread use of project management basics, the number of emergencies is increasing. The main reasons are no application of a safety-oriented management in project planning and emergency response, the lack of clear structuring of projects and no taken into account the continuous change and the impact of a turbulent project environment. However, the application of a standard project and safety-oriented management to project management cannot meet the requirements and challenges that arise, and most importantly, they cannot guarantee the complex implementation of infrastructure projects. The solution of the problem was to carry out complex detailing of the infrastructure project, to form a model of structural decomposition of the infrastructure project, which includes decomposition of the project using existing project mono-templates at different phases of the project life cycle and the impact of changes on it. Has been developed a safety-oriented structural decomposition model of an infrastructure project - a three-dimensional structure consisting of 3 parameter planes. The peculiarity of this model is the existence of interconnections of planes that arise when they intersect. Only 1 triadic point of intersection of 13 is possible, where all 3 planes intersect, forming the core of the infrastructure project and creating the prerequisites for receiving the product. On the basis of the above, a generalized model of security-oriented structural decomposition management of infrastructure projects has been formed, which is an important tool for planning, implementation and commissioning of infrastructure projects, since the interaction of the selected elements of the model is combined in such a way that provides synergies of favorable conditions for infrastructure projects realization and safe conditions of its functioning.","2766-3639","978-1-7281-7443-3","10.1109/CSIT49958.2020.9321877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321877","structural models;safety-oriented management;infrastructure projects;decomposition;project phases","Project management;Planning;Portfolios;Analytical models;Adaptation models;Standards;Systematics","emergency services;planning;project management;safety","safety-oriented management;infrastructure projects decomposition;project management;structural models;security-oriented management;project planning;emergency response;project life cycle;triadic intersection point;project commissioning","","","","22","","21 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this an automated estimation methodology called ""Auto-Estimate"" is proposed complementing Agile's manual Planning Poker. The Auto-Estimate leverages features extracted from Agile story cards, and their actual effort time. The approach is justified by evaluating alternative machine learning algorithms for effort prediction.

In the present work we are focusing on an extremely popular agile development Methodology. These methodologies are informal and lightweight in nature having short timescales. But integration of security activities with agile activities always falls short of expectations, as security practices are not able to adapt such characteristics possessed by agile software easily. Therefore a proper integration methodology is required to achieve this aim. Here we propose a novel approach which provides quantitative measure of agility for security activities in terms of real agility degree (RAD). It determines the degree of compatibility of a security activity with agile process. We have also presented a comparative analysis of security activities with each other in context of RAD and risk removal efficiency factor (RREF). RREF is an assessment of how much effective a security activity is for removing the risk. This comparison will assist a developer during software development in deciding which security activity is beneficial than the other for integration.","2326-6015","978-0-7695-4657-5","10.1109/AgileIndia.2012.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170016","Agile Processes;Security Activities;Agility Degree","Security;Programming;Testing;Documentation;Education;Analytical models;Planning","security of data;software prototyping","integration analysis;security activities;security breaches;agile software;real agility degree;risk removal efficiency factor","","7","","22","","15 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They therefore cannot provide quantitative evidence of the suitability of the customised agile method, neither assess the organisation readability to adopt it, nor help in decision-making concerning the organisation transformation strategy. In this paper, we first describe the Agile Methods Quality-Integrated Customisation framework (AM-QuICk) that relies on measurements and aims to continuously assist agile methodologists throughout the agile adoption and customisation process, i.e., during the initial organisation adoption, the method design and throughout the working development process. Then, we present a case study using AM-QuICk within an organisation. With this study, we aim to analyse the current development process and its level of agility and identify the initial risk factors. The data were collected using preliminary interviews with the different team members and two questionnaires. The results reveal that though most respondents are enthusiastic towards agile principles, a progressive transformation strategy would be beneficial.","","978-0-7695-5078-7","10.1109/IWSM-Mensura.2013.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693225","Agile Software Development;Situational Method Engineering (SME);Software Process Improvement (SPI);Agile Process Assessment;Quality Assessment Modelling","Software;Quality assessment;Context;Software measurement;Object oriented modeling;Adaptation models","risk management;software development management;software metrics;software process improvement;software prototyping;software quality","measurement-based framework;agile methods customisation;software development practitioners;organisational reality;agile adoption;customisation experiences;organisation readability;organisation transformation strategy;agile methods quality-integrated customisation framework;AM-QuICk;organisation adoption;risk factors;agile principles;software process improvement;quality assessment modelling","","4","","45","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Haven't we reached the point where agile development should be part of all software engineering curricula? And if so, shouldn't new curriculum standards ensure that it is? Thus, the answer to the question in the title of this article can be affirmative even if the computer science standards committee is absent-minded. Instructors can follow the initial call of the standard for projects by student teams while using an agile process, which is the most natural match. As long as you review both plan-and-document and agile processes in lecture, students can become familiar with both sets of terms and concepts. The more demanding outcomes can be met by the project as well, provided you look to the deeper meaning behind the plan-and-document terms to see where agile can fit.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2013.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6588520","agile;curriculum;ACM-IEEE Computer Society;software engineering","Computer science education;Software engineering;Education courses;Software systems","computer science education;educational courses;software prototyping","software engineering curriculum;standardization;agile development;curriculum standards;computer science standards committee;student teams;agile process;plan-and-document process","","1","","11","","3 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Background: Effective teamwork is crucial for agile software development’s success and is, therefore, a key topic of current software engineering education. In the previous work, a preliminary proposal for ASEST+ was presented. Here, an improved version, more suitable for agile practice education and considering cohesion antecedents, is described. Intended Outcome: A teaching-learning framework to support teamwork in agile software education. Application Design: ASEST+ is built around Scrum teams and combines learning strategies to train students in collaborative and technical agile practices. ASEST+ establishes policies for role allocation and team rule agreements to regulate communication and address conflict management agile practices. ASEST+ addresses personality traits, conflict resolution, and task interdependence as the antecedents identified as the most important. Findings: A quasiexperiment showed that the use of ASEST+ significantly increases the students’ positive perceptions on team cohesion, team performance, and team learning compared with the control group.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2021.3084095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9449480","Agile software development (ASD);software engineering education (SEE);team-based learning;team cohesion;team development;team dynamics;team learning;team performance;teamwork training","Teamwork;Software;Task analysis;Bibliographies;Software engineering;Education;Games","computer science education;educational courses;human factors;project management;software agents;software development management;software prototyping;teaching;team working","agile software engineering education;ASEST+ framework;agile software engineers;team cohesion;team learning;software engineering student teams;effective teamwork;agile software development;current software engineering education;agile practice education;teaching-learning framework;agile software education;collaborative practices;technical agile practices;team performance;cohesion antecedents;conflict management agile practices","","1","","81","IEEE","9 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is a social conflict between the two teams. Agile teams are more people oriented and non-Agile teams are more documentation and process oriented with required “sign off” documents as software is moved into a production environment. This paper describes such a situation and the solution which was generated. This solution was automated tests which actually generated printed reports in the appropriate form for the production team. The printed test results along with the printed test cases could then be “signed off” and the software moved into production.","","978-1-5386-3831-6","10.1109/NEXTCOMP.2017.8016167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8016167","Agile;automated testing","Software;Production;Testing;Documentation;Pipelines;Companies","program testing;software prototyping","automated testing;tangible printed reports;agile methodologies;SCRUM;XP;corporate environment;agile development teams;production gate keeper;production team;live environment;nonagile teams;sign off documents;production environment;printed test cases;software","","","","9","","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there is a little research to affirm its impact and give guidance as to how much effort should be spent on planning to achieve best results. We aim to rectify this omission. Data was collected on 1386 projects from 859 respondents via a global survey. A significant relationship was found between the quality of the planning deliverables and success. Detailed analysis of the data collected revealed an inverted-U relationship between the percentage of effort spent on planning and project success. After correcting for key moderator effects, a significant relationship with an R2 of 0.15 was revealed. Further analysis showed that the fraction of planning effort that maximized the project success was 25% of project effort. This was substantially more than the 15% mean value reported by respondents. The greatest impact was found to be on the broad success measures with a lesser effect on project efficiency: time; budget; and scope. The inverted-U relationship between effort spent on planning and project success indicates that projects can spend too much time in planning, as well as too little. But we found that projects are spending less time in planning than the optimum to achieve best results.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2015.2448059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165629","Efficiency;planning;project;success;Efficiency;planning;project;success","Project management;Correlation;Planning","budgeting;planning;project management","project success;global survey;inverted-U relationship;project efficiency;budget;planning deliverables quality;project planning","","8","","55","IEEE","23 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nowadays, it has become the most well-known technique because it accepts the change requirements of the projects. Hence, it is difficult to get precise cost estimation because of continuous changes. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that in the context of ASD, various effort estimation techniques have been reported. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing effort estimation techniques/models do not include the additional factors needed to compute accurate effort estimation in the context of ASD. It is beneficial to identify all the factors contributing to the cost overhead to improve the agile effort estimation process. Thus, the research aims to find out important and relevant factors in the ASD context. Moreover, the most common challenges and reasons for improving effort estimation in ASD are also highlighted.

Further, little is known about project execution capabilities that may be central to improving the performance of offshore technology projects. This study attempts to shed light on the above issues using data from technology projects distributed within and across country boundaries. The study findings are twofold. First, a comparative analysis of project performance across 702 technology projects reveals that projects executed offshore realize significantly lower performance related to quality and technical goals compared with projects executed within country boundaries. Second, a subsequent in-depth analysis of the offshore technology projects in the sample highlights the enabling but differential performance effects of project execution capabilities. Specifically, we find that while risk management planning capability is central to improving project adherence to schedule and budgetary goals, agile project management capability is central to improving project adherence to quality and technical goals in technology projects executed offshore. The study concludes with a discussion of the findings, implications for technology research and practice, limitations, and directions for future research.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2017.2662021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7892006","Agile management;offshoring;project execution capability;project performance;project quality;project sourcing;risk management","Schedules;Context;Risk management;Organizations;Project management","project management;research and development management;risk management","project quality;offshore technology project;project sourcing structures;offshoring efforts;risk management planning capability;project adherence","","5","","82","IEEE","4 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such a method for computer science education, that supports project-based learning agile projects are being discussed more recently. In the context of a design-based research work, experienced teachers have adapted and applied a theory-derived agile model in a wide range of contexts. In this qualitative case-study, we analyze 11 interviews with 6 teachers on their observations from 20 agile projects with over 400 students. The aim is to gain insight into how agile practices assist individual learning processes and how they help teachers to design and organize projects in order to support students individually. A structured content analysis shows that agile teams face similar obstacles as teams in plandriven projects, but that they can overcome them better in agile projects. Additionally, the analysis indicates that in agile projects the quantity and quality of interactions increases, which has positive effects on the construction of sustainable skills and that students furthermore are frequently involved in feedback processes and reflections, which makes their learning more goal-oriented. Moreover, the data shows that teachers can identify their students' strengths and weaknesses better and also observe their individual learning processes better throughout agile project. Based on that knowledge they can design their agile project in a way that each student is challenged systematically and purposefully.","2165-9567","978-1-5386-2957-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8363364","agile methods;computer science education;K-12;project-based learning;individual differences;cooperative learning;heterogeneity","Education;Adaptation models;Programming profession;Collaboration;Software;Computational modeling","computer aided instruction;computer science education;programming;project management;software prototyping;teaching;team working","individual learning processes;agile projects learning;cooperative learning;programming teaching;computer science education","","2","","52","","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A systematic analysis of software practices used in continuous deployment can facilitate a better understanding of continuous deployment as a software engineering process. Such analysis can also help software practitioners in having a shared vocabulary of practices and in choosing the software practices that they can use to implement continuous deployment. The goal of this paper is to aid software practitioners in implementing continuous deployment through a systematic analysis of software practices that are used by software companies. We studied the continuous deployment practices of 19 software companies by performing a qualitative analysis of Internet artifacts and by conducting follow-up inquiries. In total, we found 11 software practices that are used by 19 software companies. We also found that in terms of use, eight of the 11 software practices are common across 14 software companies.

This is due to lack of objective surveys on the subject. The surveys that have been conducted so far are of a subjective nature and have mostly been performed by tool vendors. They are very limited in number and focus mainly on company structure and adherence to a specific Agile method rather than on tool usage and needs. For this reason, many companies have difficulties to choose appropriate tools to support their Agile process. One such company is the Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson. To account for this lack of data, Ericsson commissioned us to conduct an independent survey focusing on the tool usage and needs as experienced by the Agile software community today. In this paper, we report on the results of our survey. The survey covers 121 responses from 120 different companies coming from 35 different countries. Our results show that the most satisfactory tool aspect is ease of use, whereas the least satisfactory one is lack of integration with other systems.

This is the story of how one product team used creativity, communications tools, and basic good engineering practices to build a successful product.","","0-7695-2872-4","10.1109/AGILE.2007.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293626","","Books;Project management;Space technology;Engineering management;Knowledge transfer;Feedback loop;Productivity;Process planning;Collaboration","DP industry","agile principles;distributed scrum team;product team;communications tools;engineering practices","","33","","3","","27 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve the purpose, we conducted qualitative study. We discussed with practitioners methods to handle risks and risk sharing mechanism in contracts. Interview findings revealed that almost all practitioners handle risk like traditional waterfall approach. All major risks are listed in matrix form. These risks are monitored continuously during entire development process and their probability of occurrence is assessed. At next step, mitigation plan is designed according to their probability of occurrence. Estimation risks are mitigated using relative estimates. Other ways to handle risks include keeping the sprint/iteration shorter and SWOT analysis. In most projects, risk sharing between supplier and customer is not defined in the contracts. It is assumed that for fixed price contracts risk lies on supplier side, for time and material contacts most of the risk lies towards customer side.

Agile project management is the newest trend in project management methods that support concepts of flexibility and continuous improvements which help to keep an organization's workforce efficient and motivated and reflect positively on employee retention. In this theoretical paper, we aim to critically analyze how the various Agile methods support employee retention better than traditional approaches by matching employee retention's best practices within its approach.

We explore suitable DT practices to satisfy customer expectations in agile teams using inductive reasoning. We first formulated a conceptual framework based on a literature review. We then conducted a set of interviews with fifteen domain experts from ten IT service organizations. Interview findings were then analyzed using the Straussian grounded theory. Customer journey, story mapping, prototypes, POC, and customer profiling were determined to be the most suitable methods to identify the needs of customers. Moreover, practicing human-centered approach through workshops, discussions, team communication, and end-user interaction through UAT were also identified to be effective. We further classified the best practices into five categories as customer's real need identification, transforming customer's real needs into pilot solutions, visualizing the pilot solution for customer feedback, idea generation for the pilot solution, and brainstorming. Based on these findings, we also derived a framework to achieve customer satisfaction through the adoption of DT in agile-base projects.","","978-1-5386-4417-1","10.1109/MERCon.2018.8422006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8422006","agile practices;design thinking;design thinking practices;grounded theory","Organizations;Interviews;Software;Industries;Best practices;Customer satisfaction","customer satisfaction;DP industry;human computer interaction;human factors;organisational aspects;software development management;software prototyping;strategic planning","customer expectation satisfaction;Sri Lankan software development industry;DT practices;human-centered approach;end-user interaction;UAT;customer real need identification;idea generation;brainstorming;agile-base projects;customer satisfaction;customer feedback;pilot solution;team communication;customer profiling;customer journey;Design Thinking practices;agile teams;project success;agile principles;agile practices","","3","","18","","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence of improper job allocation, clients may refuse to accept the project, team members may be demonized, and the project may collapse. Numerous scholars have spent the past decade researching different techniques for work allocation in Distributed Agile settings, and the results have been promising. Ontologies and Bayesian networks were among the techniques they employed. This is a list of brute force techniques that may be useful in certain situations. Additionally, these methods have not been used to distributed Agile software development job allocation.

There are multiple tools available in industry to manage project but they are lacking to provide planning while considering all these factors. Genetic algorithms (GA) have arisen from concepts, introduced from the natural process of biological evolution. GA uses selection, crossover and mutation to evolve a solution to the given problem.

Still, it remains unclear what is necessary to monitor a project and to track its progress from a management perspective. A solution is to monitor projects and their progress on basis of the current quality of the created artifacts according to a given reference model that defines the artifacts and their dependencies.

A pattern is a general solution to a common problem or issue, one from which a specific solution may be derived. This paper introduces concept of pattern into software process and organizes experience proved to be effective in agile methods as a group of patterns. Based on this group of process patterns, we propose a process pattern language PPL for agile methods.

In this context, it is important to find new ways to assist learners through the journey of learning while improving their motivation. Recently, the application of agile project management methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming, has emerged as an option to be adopted inside the classroom aiming to improve learning. Due to their capabilities of flexibilization of student's self-regulation, these methodologies have become an interesting option in an educational environment hence their high adaptability to requirements changes that may occur during the time. In other words, new requirements can be perceived by the teacher, for instance, learning a new tool that was not planned on before, and, therefore, the class plan can be modified to accommodate this new necessity.

You've got help in the form of an Agile Coach and you understand that change is required to get these benefits, not only for the Scrum teams directly affected but also in the way you think about and approach development projects. The transition is making progress, and you are seeing improvements at all levels but you cannot help feeling that you've lost an understanding of the key decisions that the organization needs to make. You still have to run the business, to make commitments, and to release products. In the past you had information from the product teams that allowed you to understand where the issues were. That information seems to have disappeared. When you ask for it, you are given a “release burn-up chart” and are told that “Scrum means we respond to change” and “we don't do big upfront planning any more.” How can you get what you need and still be “Scrum”, still be “agile”?","","978-1-4673-2622-3","10.1109/Agile.2012.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298103","Scrum;agile;executive management;culture;adoption","Organizations;Investments;Resource management;Software;Standards organizations;Planning","business data processing;organisational aspects;productivity;project management;software quality","quality improvement;productivity improvement;agile coach;Scrum teams;organization needs;product release;product teams;executive management;release burn-up chart","","","","","","13 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, have emerged in part to address this challenge. Agile focuses on a set of best practices rather than a standardized process, which makes it difficult to assess whether it is being properly implemented in an organization. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of using process mining to evaluate the implementation of Scrum practices based on event logs collected from a case-handling system. A case study was conducted in an IT organization that uses Jira Software to manage its projects. With process mining, it was possible to extract the workflow behaviour in two different projects. While Scrum standards like role distribution could be discovered, other practices like customer collaboration could not be detected in the log. This case study provided important insights regarding the application of process mining in case-handling systems and Scrum processes.","2378-1971","978-1-5386-7016-3","10.1109/CBI.2018.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8452664","Agile software development, Scrum methodology, process mining, case-handling systems","Data mining;Software;Organizations;Scrum (Software development);Tools;Planning;Standards organizations","data mining;project management;software development management;software prototyping","process mining;Scrum practices;case-handling system;Jira Software;Scrum standards;Scrum processes;agile methodologies;agile software development processes;event logs","","2","","","","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, some of the requirements remain unknown until late stages of the product development project, which makes it more difficult to generate the right product features. This is mainly caused by volatilely changing customer expectations. One promising approach to address these challenges is the application of agile methods from the software industry to the development of physical products. Nevertheless, most companies are not able to adapt this approach and therefore adhere to plan-driven development methods. This is due to a lack of profound knowledge in transferring agile methods to the development of highly interdependent physical products. This paper aims at the presentation of a methodology, which determines the application suitability of agile methods for the development of highly interdependent products. Therefore, the type and degree of interdependencies between individual product scopes are analyzed. Based on this investigation and the application of Agile Indicators, an evaluation of development scopes regarding their suitability for agile development is derived. The developed methodology can be used to ensure the right degree of agility in physical product development. The applicability of the proposed methodology is shown with the practical case of a small manufacturer of electric cars.","","978-1-890843-36-6","10.23919/PICMET.2017.8125363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8125363","","Product development;Companies;Iterative methods;Agile manufacturing;Software;Visualization","agile manufacturing;automobile manufacture;customer satisfaction;customer services;DP industry;electric vehicles;knowledge management;manufacturing industries;product customisation;product development;product life cycle management;production engineering computing;software prototyping","agile methods;heterogeneous customer requirements;short product life cycles;corporate knowledge;electric cars manufacturer;software industry;manufacturing companies;highly interdependent physical product development","","7","","36","","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, scholars and practitioners tried to define flexibility and find ways to make project management more flexible. However, scientific literature about practitioners' perspectives on making project management flexible is lacking. Therefore, this paper explores practitioners' perspectives on project management flexibility by the use of Q-methodology. The scope of the paper was narrowed down to the front-end phase of infrastructure projects. Two types of organizations were targeted: client and consultancy organizations. Data were gathered from 43 respondents from six organizations (three client and three consultancy organizations) in The Netherlands. The results of the study reveal three distinct perspectives on flexibility for both organization types (client and consultant): flexibility by trust, flexibility by scope management, and flexibility by proactive management. These perspectives partly support defined flexibility categories in literature. Further research could focus on exploring the perspectives in different project phases, operationalizing the perspectives in practice, and team composition taking into account these perspectives.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2019.2914833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735747","Agile project management;construction industry;flexible project management;planning phase;Q-methodology","Project management;Complexity theory;Organizations;Uncertainty;Bibliographies;Standards organizations;Planning","organisational aspects;project management","flexible project management;waterfall approach;infrastructure projects;consultancy organizations;organization types;scope management;proactive management;client organizations;The Netherlands;team composition;mechanistic project management;organic project management;Q-methodology","","1","","71","IEEE","12 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet the majority of Scrum teams never achieve this design goal. Teams do not know how to sequence work to deliver working software at the end of a sprint. They do not know how to work with a Product Owner to get the backlog in a ready state before bringing it into a sprint and do not know how to self-organize into a hyper-productive state during a sprint. A pattern is emerging at MySpace in California and Jayway in Sweden, for bootstrapping high performing Scrum teams. Rigorous implementation of Scrum by an experienced coach creates a total immersion experience akin to Shock Therapy. Teams are trained on exactly how to implement Scrum with no deviations for several sprints. These teams consistently achieve better than 240% improvement in velocity within a few weeks. They are then able to self-organize on their own to continue to improve performance. For many developers and managers, the experience is a wake up call to agile awareness. Unfortunately, management tends to disrupt hyper-productive teams by disabling key constraints in the Scrum framework. Team velocity then falls back into mediocrity. Velocity data is provided on five hyper-productive teams at MySpace and one team at Jayway.

Managers prefer specific project methodology/framework, while resist and face difficulties for an opportunity to manage another project with different methodology or a framework as they don't know how much commonality exists between the preferred and the new required methodology/framework. The crux of this paper is to present an understanding for managers and their organizations which can really augment their overall performance by having an understanding of different dynamics of different project management methodologies/frameworks and then use this understanding intelligently either by combining different powerful features or simply by knowing the equivalency with competitors which are using other project management methodologies/frameworks. This paper can be a good resource for the project managers having difficulty in deciding which and why a particular project management methodology/framework should be opted. To parameterize the scope of this paper, five important project management methodologies/frameworks were compared with PMBOK, which is a growing and established project management methodology. Finally a conclusion with a generic project management approach has been suggested.","","978-1-4244-1246-4","10.1109/ICIET.2007.4381330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4381330","","Project management;Software engineering;Application software;Buildings;Resists;Energy management;Resource management;Skeleton;Guidelines;Knowledge management","project management;software management","software project management;project management methodology;project management framework;project managers;PMBOK","","6","","25","","12 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So it was necessary to design the game in computer version as well. The game was played in a board version, compared to the theoretical interpretation, the practical version of the agile approach and Scrum framework was found to be more beneficial. The agile game concept was designed so that the game could be played within 90 minutes. In order to play the game successfully, students have to go through a lecture where the rules and concept of the whole game, how agile approach works, and also the Scrum framework was explained in detail.","2576-3555","978-1-7281-5953-9","10.1109/CoDIT49905.2020.9263937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9263937","","Games;Software;Tools;Project management;Scrum (Software development);Education;Task analysis","computer aided instruction;computer science education;project management;serious games (computing);software prototyping;software tools","software tool;computer science students;board-based game;computer version;board version;agile game;education purposes;JIRA;IT project management;Scrum","","1","","13","","27 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Testing scope changes when user stories are added, updated, or deleted. Moreover, test cases need to be re-written or update when user stories change or removed from the sprint, which wastes time and makes agile testers frustrated. Furthermore, the mini-waterfall model adopted within a sprint could develop unwanted stress in agile testers. Despite these challenges little seem to be understood about the challenges faced by agile testers. We fill this gap by closely studying the challenges faced by agile testers in a multinational IT services organization. We first set up a forum for agile testers to discuss their challenges, malpractices, and best practices. We then conducted an online survey based on the findings from the forum and literature review. Through this, we identified 15 challenges and best practices to overcome those 15 challenges. We further conducted a set of interviews with the subject matter expertise to identify a suitable set of solutions such as conducting retrospective in a fun and engaging way, managing story lifecycle using collaborative tools, setting up ground rules for geographically distributed teams, and introducing innovative sprints.","","978-1-5386-4417-1","10.1109/MERCon.2018.8421968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8421968","agile practice;agile tester;agile test quadrant;scrum framework","Testing;Organizations;Best practices;Software;Collaboration;Standards organizations;Automation","organisational aspects;software development management;software prototyping","agile testers;agile framework developers;geographically distributed teams;collaborative tools;multinational IT services organization","","","","15","","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aiming to support the development of successful systems, which satisfy the stakeholders' expectations, the methodology is particularly concerned with human systems integration, so the related fundamental aspects are considered throughout the engineering process. The LITHE methodology also includes a supporting graphical tool that aims to be an agile instrument to be used by systems engineers in a model-based development environment.

The method is neither a tentative step toward Agile nor a 'maturing' of an already Agile environment. Instead the Bridge is a complementary destination methodology incorporating the techniques from both Agile and Formal methods that have proven effective in large, complex software delivery environments. The method and environment are assessed within a large enterprise integration and software development project, and refined using an Action research methodology.

The initial agile problems were mainly focused on the definition of what agile methodologies are all about and empirical evidence of their successful application. Today one of the most formidable challenges is selecting appropriate agile processes for a given project and the next problem that some practitioners are already faced with is agile certification. This paper presents a selection tool that picks the agile practices relevant to a given environment. The activities that relate to each practice are used to classify the practices into either technical or social. The authors believe that all practices can be classified into technical and social oriented activities. The technical practices are those that relate to design coding and testing and the social practices relate to people issues. The practices are analyzed to this detail in order to simplify the tailoring process. In this case the environment is then viewed from the perspective of technical and social issues and it becomes easier to identify possible things that could be done to tailor the agile practices. The tool is a simple application that can be used with other project planning tools on any PC. This is part of further work based on one of the authors' PhD work. The additions include the development of a computer program to implement the tool.","","0-7695-2937-2","10.1109/ICSEA.2007.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299952","","Programming;Application software;Layout;Certification;Testing;Helium;Taxonomy;Education;Guidelines;Technical activities","program testing;software engineering;software tools","agile methodologies selection toolbox;software development;software coding design;software testing","","7","","13","","10 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, many software organizations are applying Scrum software development practices, for productivity and quality gains. Scrum calls for self-organizing teams, in which the development team has total control over its development process. However, OSS projects typically have their own processes and standards, which might not mesh well with a company's internal processes, such as Scrum. This paper presents an experience report from Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), where the ""toolchain CPU compiler"" team directly participates in the ""LLVM"" OSS project. The team ran into a number of difficulties when using Scrum to manage their development. In particular, the team often failed to complete Scrum sprints where tasks required interaction with the open source community. We look at how the team redefined task flows to alleviate these difficulties, and eventually evolved a highly modified process, dubbed TWINS (This Workflow Is Not Scrum). We assess the revised process, and compare it to other established agile methods, finding it bears a strong resemblance to Scrumban (the SIE team was not aware of Scrumban previously). The TWINS framework presented here may help other organizations who develop software in-house and engage in OSS projects, to gain the best of both worlds.","","978-1-7281-3393-5","10.1109/ICSSP.2019.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812868","agile software development, Scrum, open source software, Kanban, Scrumban","Companies;Open source software;Tools;Scrum (Software development);Task analysis","project management;public domain software;software development management;software prototyping","software organizations;Scrum software development practices;quality gains;development team;OSS projects;standards;Sony Interactive Entertainment;toolchain CPU compiler team;LLVM OSS project;Scrum sprints;open source community;highly modified process;dubbed TWINS;revised process;established agile methods;SIE team;TWINS framework;software in-house;agile process adaptation;open source software projects","","4","","48","","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the current NATO environment, long lead items, such as obtaining nationally agreed to capability packages and financial investments, are now leaving less time to engineer complex solutions in a fluctuating financial and mission environment. In addition, NATO is challenged with fielding systems to operational and system administrative users provided by 28 allied nations. This presents challenges with language, data exchange, security issues, and training for users that may rotate back to their nation every three years. This unique NATO environment has forced Project Managers (PMs) and Technical Leads (TLs) to operate with constraints imposed by contracts built around traditional systems engineering waterfall methods. In contrast, system lifecycle short timelines demand engineering solutions using agile methods supported by iterative, user validation of the system fit for purpose and usability with regard to changing peace-time and war-time missions (International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Libyan Operation Unified Protector (OUP), etc.). The NCI Agency will be fielding a new Air C2 information service (AirC2IS) in 2013. This system, AirC2IS, was partially installed for initial system validation 21 months after contract award and will be fielded to over 20 NATO sites 35 months after contract award. The system will replace an interim capability and offer a vast array of software functionalities, using a web-based design, including, but not limited to, air track management, shared early warning, air planning, theatre ballistic missile defense planning and monitoring, and collaborative tool integration. The system capabilities are being procured by NCI Agency and developed by an industry partner. The AirC2IS design phase utilized a Human Machine Interface (HMI) driven approach and the development phase an agile methodology with user validation of functionalities before formal testing. The overall systems engineering approach was tailored to reduce risks of system non-acceptance and ensure high usability and software fit for purpose, matching user requirements. This paper will present lessons learned in the procurement, development, and fielding of AirC2IS in the following areas: Project management of agile development in a traditional waterfall contract environment; Agile software development with a HMI driven approach; and Validation of systems optimizing mission flexibility.","","978-1-4673-3108-1","10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549974","Air C2;Agile;HMI Driven;User Centric;User Validation;User Centered Design","Contracts;Conferences;Training;Standards;Project management;Usability","ballistics;command and control systems;contracts;groupware;Internet;man-machine systems;military computing;missiles;monitoring;planning;program testing;program verification;project management;software prototyping;user interfaces","NATO Air Command and Control Information Services;North Atlantic Treaty Organization Communications and Information Agency;NATO Alliance operational requirements;national agreements;project managers;technical leads;system lifecycle short timelines;agile methods;peace-time missions;war-time missions;International Security Assistance Force;Libyan Operation Unified Protector;OUP;ISAF;NCI Agency;Air C2 information service;contract award;Web-based design;air track management;shared early warning;air planning;theatre ballistic missile defense planning;theatre ballistic missile defense monitoring;collaborative tool integration;AirC2IS design phase;human machine interface driven approach;HMI driven approach;agile methodology;user validation;formal testing;system nonacceptance risk reduction;procurement;agile development;waterfall contract environment;system validation","","2","","6","","1 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This gave rise to agile approaches for RE. Security, at the same time, is an essential non-functional requirement that still tends to be difficult to address in agile development contexts. Given the fuzzy notion of ""agile"" in context of RE and the difficulties of appropriately handling security requirements, the overall understanding of how to handle security requirements in agile RE is still vague. [Objective] Our goal is to characterize the publication landscape of approaches that handle security requirements in agile software projects. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping to outline relevant work and contemporary gaps for future research. [Results] In total, we identified 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria, dated from 2005 to 2017. We found that the approaches typically involve modifying agile methods, introducing new artifacts (e.g., extending the concept of user story to abuser story), or introducing guidelines to handle security issues. We also identified limitations of using these approaches related to environment, people, effort and resources. [Conclusion] Our analysis suggests that more effort needs to be invested into empirically evaluating the existing approaches and that there is an avenue for future research in the direction of mitigating the identified limitations.","","978-1-5386-7383-6","10.1109/SEAA.2018.00080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8498247","agile methods, security, requirements engineering, systematic mapping study","Security;Software;Systematics;Requirements engineering;Software engineering;Proposals;Libraries","formal specification;project management;security of data;software development management;software prototyping;systems analysis","systematic mapping study;nonfunctional requirement;agile development contexts;agile software projects;agile methods;security issues;agile requirements engineering;security requirements;business environments","","13","","49","","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Combining these two approaches has also been investigated. However, the existing research and practices only present the principles but fail to develop a framework of the software development for practitioners to follow. In this paper, a framework about how naïve agile practices could be fulfilled by introducing ""lean"" practices under the DCI (Data-Context-Interaction) paradigm is proposed. Lean practice is an end-user-focused and value-centric system design. In the proposed framework, lean architecture is complementary to agile principles and disciplines and supports agile development. This paper is exploring the possibilities of how agile methods can restore its lost insights and possibly be reinforced by lean thinking. Meanwhile, it is also examined what lean can do ""beyond"" agile. A new lean approach to building domain architecture comes from Data-Context-Interaction (DCI) paradigm which facilitates to represent the domain architecture intuitively. DCI approach allows us to successfully decouple between domain and business-logic features and provides an approach for lean practitioners to design system architecture much closer to the real-world domain. It is claimed that the investment into lean and agile methodologies go hand in hand from organizational to technical aspects by tying up with lean concepts as the backbone for agile methods. How lean makes it right and how agile makes it fast with the DCI paradigm will be demonstrated with an example. The main contribution to the software development will be presented.","","978-1-4673-0798-7","10.1109/ITNG.2012.157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209176","Agile;Lean;domain architecture;Data-Context-Interaction (DCI);software development;architectural design","Computer architecture;Business;Context;Programming;Architecture;Production;Software","software architecture;software prototyping","agile software development;lean architecture;DCI paradigm;software engineering field;agile practice;lean practice;data-context-interaction paradigm;end-user-focused system design;value-centric system design;agile principle;lean thinking;domain architecture;business-logic feature;system architecture;lean methodology;agile methodology;organizational aspect;technical aspect","","3","","15","","31 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, a complete definition of requirement specifications is often not possible, as customer needs in early development phases may strongly differ from needs in advanced phases. One way to encounter these challenges is the application of agile methods from software industry to the development of physical products. However, companies face high barriers during the implementation of agile methods in physical product development. This paper introduces a methodology to determine the application suitability of agile methods for highly interconnected physical products by using Agile Indicators. Agile Indicators are metrics that support the decision-making process for or against agile development methods at the level of individual product scopes. In order to do so, a classification of different types of development questions derived from uncertain requirements is presented. Subsequently, product scopes are determined in accordance with the existing development questions. In a next step, the derived product scopes are evaluated with Agile Indicators and the interdependencies between product scopes are analyzed. Based on this analysis a final selection of product scopes for agile development can be conducted.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-37-3","10.23919/PICMET.2018.8481926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8481926","","Product development;Companies;Software;Uncertainty;Prototypes;Manufacturing;Hardware","business data processing;decision making;DP industry;organisational aspects;project management;software development management","Agile product scopes;unpredictable business environment;customer expectations;requirement specifications;physical product development;highly interconnected physical products;agile development methods;dynamic market conditions;agile indicators","","4","","28","","7 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most agile methods break down a mobile application into small increments, which allow users to test single components and validate the value of an App. As a user satisfaction is mostly based on the validated values. However, implementing software replanning sessions for each increment allows an App to grow substantially. Over time, complexity such as in fighting bugs and fixing defects pile up, causing an increase in development costs. Since many cost estimation methods are not tailored for agile mobile development, only a few are partially applicable. With the current highly dynamic environment of Apps, this research identifies and evaluates the effectiveness of these methods to date. Key findings show a lack of appropriate and scientifically sound methods in app cost estimation. Therefore, this paper suggests new techniques in agile estimation. The main goal is to model a budgeting tool based on app decomposition, in both theoretical and practical approaches.

The benefits of agile methods compared to process-heavy models include the ability to respond faster to the changing needs of customers and the short feedback loop between customers and developers. Since agile methods depend significantly on the competence of the individual, teaching traditional approaches (e.g. waterfall) can be advantageous to the understanding of students about what the major activities associated with software development are, by providing a well-defined structure that naturally aligns with the novice student. Towards this goal, we conducted a survey with different types of software engineers, ranging from novice undergraduates to software engineering professionals. The survey provides data on the exposure of traditional and agile process, the level of experience in using traditional and agile process models, and the perceived most optimal learning sequence. Based on the analysis of the collected data, we argue that teaching traditional software engineering process-oriented approaches prior to introducing agile methods, is highly beneficial to students' understanding and optimal use of agile techniques.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658426","Software Engineering Education;Agile Methods;Traditional Waterfall Lifecycle","Software;Software engineering;Education;Agile software development;Testing;Modeling;Knowledge engineering","computer science education;further education;software prototyping;teaching","agile methods;software development;novice student;software engineering professionals;agile process models;process-oriented life cycle development models;students appreciation;software engineering students","","","","18","","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, less attention has been paid to whether or not this way of thinking and methodological processes can be fully applied to specific settings like medical startups. Some challenges such as implementation, resource allocation, working procedures, and organizational transformation could be different in shapes and forms and in intensity vis-à-vis medical startups. The study aims to cope with this deficiency by, firstly, reviewing previous empirical studies that presented process models, challenges, and positive effects of the agile manifesto and the agile-stage-gate model on well-established firms. Secondly, to investigate the agile application in startup settings, the researchers conducted a longitudinal case study by drawing on a successful medical product startup in Thailand that has engaged in the actual implementation of the agile manifesto and agile-stage-gate model in its product development. Thirdly, the study compared the results of implementing the agile in large firms and the medical startup case in this study to investigate similarities and differences in terms of challenges and effects. The study showed both correlations in the same and contrasting directions of the previous studies and the case study’s results. The findings of this study can be created and categorized into four aspects of applying the agile-stage-gate in a startup, including balance transformation, work process, person-job fit, and team collaboration. Additionally, the study revealed the relationship among these four aspects, which together form an agile model for medical startups that balance between the long-term objectives and short-term goals, the adaptability and predictability, and the flexibility and rigidity of the set objectives.","","978-1-6654-0482-2","10.1109/TEMSMET51618.2020.9557442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9557442","agile;stage-gate;new product development;startup;balance transformation","Adaptation models;Correlation;Shape;Conferences;Entrepreneurship;Collaboration;Predictive models","organisational aspects;product development;project management;resource allocation","agile-stage-gate model;medical startups;agile manifesto;product development process;well-established firms;agile application;successful medical product startup;medical startup case;agile model","","","","11","","6 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, we also investigated the perception of an agile team from a Federal Public Administration organization regarding the impacts of the obligation to develop software in accordance with the LGPD. Results: Our findings reveal that agile teams know the concepts related to data privacy legislation, but they do not use the techniques proposed in the literature to perform privacy requirements elicitation. In addition, agile teams face problems with outdated software requirements specifications and stakeholders’ lack of knowledge regarding data privacy. Conclusions: Agile teams need to improve their knowledge on privacy requirements.","2332-6441","978-1-6654-2856-9","10.1109/RE51729.2021.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604706","Privacy Requirements Elicitation;Agile Teams;Perception;LGPD","Privacy;Data privacy;Systematics;Agile software development;Legislation;Information security;Tools","data privacy;formal specification;law;legislation;public administration;reviews;security of data;software development management;software prototyping","privacy requirements elicitation;Brazilian General Data Protection Law;agile software development team members;agile team;data privacy legislation;LGPD;Brazil;systematic literature review;ASD;federal public administration organization","","","","67","","18 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to allow fast and reliable development processes, several agile methodologies have been designed and are now quite popular. Although existing agile methodologies are abundant, companies are increasingly interested in the construction of their own customized methods to fit their specific environment. In this paper, we investigate how agile methods can be constructed in-house to address specific software process needs. First, we examine a case study focusing on the tailoring of two agile methodologies, XP and Scrum. Then, we focus on the high-level scope of any agile method customization and investigate an approach based on the Situational Method Engineering (SME) paradigm that includes measurement concepts for constructing context specific agile methodologies. We also examine several existing metamodels proposed for use in SME. Finally, we introduce an agile metamodel designed to support the construction of agile methods and relying on measurements to provide guidance to agile methodologists during the construction phase and throughout the development process itself.","","978-1-4673-2345-1","10.1109/QUATIC.2012.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6511783","Situational Method Engineering (SME);Agile methods metamodeling;Quality Assessment Modeling;Process tailoring;Measurement","","software prototyping;software quality","metamodel-based approach;agile method customization;agile method assessment;high quality software;software process;XP;Scrum;situational method engineering paradigm;SME paradigm;measurement concepts;context specific agile methodology;agile metamodel;construction phase","","4","","39","","2 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this research is to study knowledge creation and sharing practices in a number of distributed agile projects, map these practices to the knowledge management strategies and determine which strategies are most common, which are applied only locally and which are applied globally. This is done by conducting a series of semi-structured qualitative interviews over a period of time span during May, 2012-June, 2013.

Findings suggested that agile methodologies are not preferred choice when developing large-scale projects, safety critical software projects and for projects in which requirements are known at upfront. Findings revealed that waterfall methodologies are more suitable for those kinds of projects. Waterfall approaches have many benefits therefore it is not recommended to discard it completely for sake of agile methods. On the basis of the findings and discussion, we recommend using combination of agile and waterfall approaches together. In this way, benefits of certain features from both methodologies can be used according to type of the project.","","978-1-4799-3312-9","10.1109/ITMC.2014.6918615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918615","Agile methodologies;Waterfal methodologies;Large complex software;Security and real time projects","Software;Scrum (Software development);Organizations;Interviews;Documentation;Security;Real-time systems","project management;safety-critical software;software engineering;software management","waterfall methodologies;safety critical software projects;software development;Norway;large complex software projects","","3","","31","","9 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the novel solution of using change-impact knowledge as the main driver for agile architecting. The solution consists of a Change Impact Analysis technique and a set of models to assist agile architects in the change (decision-making) process by retrieving the change-impact architectural knowledge resulting from adding or changing features iteration after iteration.

Some authors have argued that ASD methods have limited applicability to large-scale projects because agile stories are not sufficient to capture the complexities of up-front design. This paper reports a 2.5-year field study of how an ASD team for a complex software system adapted the user story concept and the Scrum approach. The team sought to create a convention for representing agile stories which could capture the complexities of the system requirements without burdening the team with unneeded documentation. They developed eight different ways to represent a story. The core representation of the approach was called a HyperEpic, a structured collection of closely-related HyperStories. HyperEpics required 90-99% fewer words than conventional specifications. Because of their dense form, Hyper-epics were not useful for other phases in the design/build processes. The team evolved a design/build work practice that proceeded in stages. In each stage, stories underwent a one or more transformations. Each transformation represented stories differently to create varied kinds of understandings among different stakeholder sets. The team was able to gain the benefits of ASD - faster development cycles, less documentation, rapid adaptation to insights and conditions.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-4525-7","10.1109/HICSS.2012.684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6149538","","Variable speed drives;Collaboration;Formal specifications;Prototypes;Documentation;Complexity theory;Software","computational complexity;formal specification;formal verification;software architecture;software prototyping","design process;design product;large scale agile development project;agile software development;software requirement;ASD method;upfront design complexity;ASD team;complex software system;user story concept;Scrum approach;system requirement complexity;unneeded documentation;closely-related HyperStories;HyperEpics;design-build process;design-build work practice;development cycle;rapid adaptation","","9","","10","","9 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If requirements interdependencies are neglected, it can cause unexpected cost increase and this can be detrimental to startups given the limited resources that they have. Objective: The objectives of the study is to explore and identify practices and challenges associated with managing requirements interdependencies in Agile software development. Method: We employed a web-based survey as a data collection approach. To analyse the data we used open coding as the data collected was primarily qualitative. Results: The results shows that 50% of respondents consider requirements interdependencies. Agile practices such as Kan-ban/Scrum board, retrospectives, and iteration planning, were used by the respondents in the context of managing requirements interdependencies. A number of tools like Jira and Git were also identified in the survey. Challenges identified were inefficient processes, incremental modification rate, and dependencies to other services. Conclusions: Requirements interdependencies should be managed early in the startup lifecycle because it can be expensive and complex as the software evolves and grows. Agile software development still lacks support and guidelines for practitioners to manage requirements interdependencies as part of agile methodologies. The findings in this study can help startups with, for example, identifying useful practices and understanding the challenges they will face. However, more research needs to be done to support software startups to maintain an efficient process in managing requirements interdependencies despite their growth.","","978-1-5090-2935-8","10.1109/ICE/ITMC39735.2016.9025919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9025919","Agile software development;requirements interdependencies;software startup;survey","Agile software development;Software;Encoding;Tools;Companies;Software engineering;Data analysis","formal specification;Internet;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping","agile software development;requirements interdependencies;software startups;Web-based survey","","","","16","","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both of these characteristics cause accumulation of technical debt, something that is the end result of either intentional or unintentional decisions. The ability of these methods to function with technical debt indicates that they contain components with inherent technical debt management capabilities. This study conducts a survey on industry practitioners to discover what is their level of technical debt knowledge, how does technical debt manifest in their projects and which of the applied components of agile software development -- both processes and practices -- are sensitive to technical debt. This paper contributes to the technical debt discussion by showing differences in assumed and indicated technical debt knowledge. Furthermore, components closest to implementation and its maintenance are perceived to have the most positive effects on technical debt management. Finally, the most encountered instances of technical debt are caused by architectural inadequacies, they are internal legacy, and increase in size as a result of continued implementation.","","978-1-4799-6791-9","10.1109/MTD.2014.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974888","technical debt;agile software development practices;agile software development processes;survey","Software;Agile software development;Industries;Companies;Programming;Standards","software prototyping","agile software development;industry practitioner survey;requirement erratic environments;resource scarce;technical debt knowledge;technical debt manifest;technical debt management;architectural inadequacies","","21","","27","","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, the mix and variation of both, so-called ‘hybrid’ approaches become more and more important, opening a new field of research questions. The article represents a brief overview of the state of art in the field of hybrid approaches, in order to analyse their application for managing public-funded projects in higher educational institutions (HEIs). It summarizes the results of the study on the EuroPIM project case — a funded project implemented within the consortium of five European HEIs. During its implementation a decision has been made to implement the elements of an agile approach for managing the project within the existing project portfolio. Nevertheless, publicly-funded HEI projects come with certain requirements which result in heavy-weight processes. Thus, a hybrid approach per se is to be set up. The implemented approach is analysed in terms of the usefulness for public-funded projects in HEIs. The characteristics of the specific project play a big role in this process. Therefore, the paper analyses to which extent these specific challenges are addressed by the PM approach.","","978-1-5386-0697-1","10.1109/IDAACS.2017.8095085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8095085","hybrid approach;project management system;managing projects in HEIs","Project management;Organizations;Standards organizations;Tools;Europe;Planning;Education","educational institutions;further education;investment;project management","hybrid approach;public-funded projects;HEIs;EuroPIM project case;funded project;agile approach;heavy-weight processes;PM approach;project management approach;heavy-weight approaches;light-weight approaches;project portfolio;hybrid approaches","","","","17","","7 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While some designer-developer collaborations were directed towards planning, which has been extensively researched, a larger part was directed towards realignment work. This latter type of collaborative work took three basic forms: scheduled, impromptu, and chats. Regardless of the form of collaboration, designer-developer interactions were mediated by twelve categories of artefacts.

It has a great impact on customer satisfaction and business welfare. Normally the selection is based on experience or in some cases a rational. In the third world countries and especially in Sudan, where this research is conducted, the choice of a software methodology is always a struggle in software companies. Probably is because most of these companies whether are startup or have humble resources such as small to medium enterprises (SMEs). Currently the government of Sudan (the main buyer of local software products) is pushing the software industry to produce quality products and to reduce risks of buying software products from foreign companies, therefore quality products is real concern for these companies. Usually, start-up or SMEs software companies seeking for rapid and agile way of development accompanied with plug & play engineering practices. Agile software development methodologies become lately the way forward quality assurance. Since the last decade, agile methods have increased popularity and usage among software industries. These methods came to tackle requirement changes quickly, satisfy customers, support interaction, communication and produce high quality products. There are a lot of debates in the literature about agile methods especially on the most newest and used ones. However, academic research on how these SMEs can select the appropriate method still limited. The aim of this paper is to filling this gap by systematically reviewing the existing literature on the most popular agile software development methodologies. This paper has three purposes: first, it proposes a definition and discussion of the most popular agile software development methods. Second, it explores the software SMEs challenges and formulates it into criteria for comparison purposes. Third, it compares these methods and shows their similarities and differences against the defined criteria.

An appropriate task-member assignment facilitates project management, lessens the complexities and influences chances of project success. Task allocation becomes a more challenging activity in a distributed agile software development due to insufficient understanding of different factors and dependencies involved. We propose a task allocation framework comprising of two phases: one, identifying factors and dependencies that strongly influence the task allocation decision; two, proposing a quantitative method that allocates tasks to team members who best match the task requirements. Task requirements are expressed as capabilities, catering for different aspects, such as technical, personal, and environment. Our method stays transparent to the targeted objectives, in this case the best match. Other objectives, such as quality and cost may be introduced conveniently; even multiple objectives can be addressed. Such a method also allows quality evaluation of task-member assignment during and after the project completion, toward minimizing related risks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2803685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8294060","Software engineering;Agile software development;distributed software development;task allocation method;task allocation framework","Task analysis;Resource management;Software;Object oriented modeling;Agile software development;Tools;Load modeling","decision making;distributed processing;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping","appropriate task-member assignment facilitates project management;distributed agile software development;task allocation framework comprising;task allocation decision;allocates tasks;team members;task requirements;emergent software application markets","","16","","44","OAPA","16 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In globally distributed software projects the development and testing are often scattered across multiple locations forming virtual teams. Further, the distributed projects are so complex that none of team members can possibly possess all the knowledge about the project individually. During testing in such teams, developers and testers need to coordinate and communicate frequently. However, coordination is affected by the availability of the project information, which is distributed among different project members and organizational structures. Many companies are facing decisions about how to apply agile methods in their distributed projects. These companies are often motivated by the opportunities of solving the coordination and communication difficulties associated with global software development. In this paper we investigate the communication between testers and developers in two teams from two software companies performing continuous agile testing in a distributed setting. We describe four communication practices used by the team: handover through issue tracker system, formal meetings, written communication and coordination by mutual adjustment. We also discuss communication between testers and developers in collocated versus distributed testers and developers. We have found that early participation of the testers is very important to the success of the handover between testers and developers. The communication between developers and testers is not sufficiently effective through written communication and that it changes depending on the type of the tasks and experience of the testers.","2329-6313","978-1-5090-2680-7","10.1109/ICGSE.2016.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577420","Continuous Agile Testing;Global Software Development;Communication","Software;Companies;Software testing;Interviews;Agile software development;Context","program testing;software development management;software prototyping","distributed continuous agile testing;software developers;software testers;software development projects;globally distributed software projects;virtual teams;team members;project members;organizational structures;software companies","","11","","36","","29 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The principal objectives of this paper are to introduce a fundamental basis for evaluation frameworks that target existing challenges, and also to evaluate existing evaluation frameworks in order to identify their shortcomings. To this aim, we have proposed an evaluation criterion set, or meta- criteria, according to which existing evaluation frameworks have been assessed. These meta-criteria define the essential features that an appropriate evaluation framework is expected to possess. The evaluation results show that existing evaluation frameworks do not satisfy typical requirements, and fail to address existing challenges. Therefore, the need still remains for an appropriate and useful evaluation framework for appraising agile methodologies.","","978-0-7695-3141-0","10.1109/ECBS.2008.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4492423","Evaluation;Agile Methodologies","Appraisal;Programming;Project management;Engineering management;Application software;Conferences;Software development management;Assembly;Software engineering;Performance analysis","software performance evaluation","evaluation frameworks;agile software development methodologies;meta-criteria","","10","","21","","18 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although simulation methods and tools have been introduced to alleviate these problems, there is a lack of simulation approaches that integrate software project knowledge, software development processes, project-related situation-awareness, and learning techniques to help project managers to make more informed decisions and hence reach successful conclusions with software projects. In addition, in order to be more proactive, such approaches need to provide simulations based on both static and dynamic situation-awareness data, support (self-)adaptive project planning and execution, and recommend remedial courses of action when real-time project anomalies occur. In this context, this PhD research aims to create an integrated multi-agent-based simulation to support software project management in a more comprehensive way.","1558-1225","978-1-4799-1934-5","10.1109/ICSE.2015.290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7203112","software project management;multi-agent-based simulation","Software;Data models;Project management;Adaptation models;Planning;Real-time systems;Decision making","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;planning;project management;software development management","integrated multiagent-based simulation approach;software project management;software development processes;project-related situation-awareness;learning techniques;static situation-awareness data;dynamic situation-awareness data;self-adaptive project planning","","2","","11","","17 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The project leader is confronted with the challenge of selecting the suitable project management methods in order to ensure an effective development of the product. However, in most cases, the selected methods are not directly applicable. Therefore, the methods have to be tailored to the specific project context. In addition, project management methods have to be considered adequately in process planning for a problem-free execution. Hence, this paper presents an approach for a methodology to support the project leader in selecting and tailoring project management methods and project processes.

The findings highlight that construction supply chains may benefit by adopting agile principles. A number of common supply chain problems experienced by manufacturers in the construction industry are outlined and a number of potential solutions are presented. While this research offers a detailed examination of specific supply chains, further work is required to produce results that can be more readily generalised. A number of areas are identified for further research.

Our results from 30 teams in small to large size projects cover the perceptions of a variety of roles and indicate that the adoption is a learning process in three interdependent phases: Environment, System and Architecture. The participants in our study perceived the biggest gaps in the usefulness of available design and requirements documentation.

An interpretative qualitative approach using case studies has been adopted to gain deeper insights into how such teams work. The analysis is being informed by theoretical concepts of awareness, common ground and boundary objects. Early findings suggest that distributed team members use multifaceted techniques, such as shared software artifacts that evolve over time to negotiate and enhance common ground for better collaborative practices to emerge.

Landslides and earthquakes are natural disasters that often occur in Indonesia. The objective of the research is to develop landslide and earthquake early warning system applications for smartphone devices with Android operating system. Current smartphone contains low cost sensors able to detect movement. Despite of less accuracy than scientific instruments, but the ubiquity of smartphone can cover larger area. Crowdsourcing the data collection also reduces the false positive rate caused by the sensor. We embed our prediction model in Android application to distinguish between earthquake and common human activity. Further, the data is sent to cloud server if predicted as earthquake. When the number of user reported the same event at the same time in certain area met the threshold, push notification then delivered to smartphone user which may have impact by the event. We use data from Sistem Informasi Kebencanaan - Longsor by Research Center for Geotechnology to develop landslide early warning system. When smartphone user entering area with highly landslide potential, the would receive notification about the area potential. This research uses Agile method to develop early warning system on Android device. Research activities are conducted in 6 (six) phases: requirement, plan, design, develop, release, track & monitor.

To perform the study we have followed the Goleman’s leadership classification and the Marquet’s and Kniberg’s self-management models. Besides the previous concepts, we also investigate how different leadership styles exert alignment and autonomy within agile teams.

However measuring and/or assessing reliability of developed software is nevertheless a very important task and there seems to be a natural fit between SRE and agile in driving certification testing. SRE typically focuses on directing test efforts after software has been created in order to achieve a predetermined failure intensity objective (FIO). It also uses reliability growth models in order to predict when the software will meet the FIO, and therefore can be released. While these ideas may initially seem incompatible with the test-driven emphasis of agile methods, we show that SRE does in fact have value within the agile process context.","0840-7789","1-4244-1020-7","10.1109/CCECE.2007.178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4232837","","Software reliability;Reliability engineering;Programming;Software testing;Process planning;Electronic mail;Computer industry;Software measurement;Certification;Predictive models","failure analysis;program testing;project management;software reliability","software reliability engineering;agile software development;software industry;software project artifacts;certification testing;failure intensity objective;software testing","","4","","10","","30 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The Project Strategy Matrix: Systematizing the Design and Management of an Explicit Project Strategy","G. Koutsoukos","Department of Computer Science, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, U.K.","IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","24 Nov 2020","2021","68","1","249","264","The notion of project strategy, i.e., the strategy of an individual project, remains an open field of investigation. Despite the significance of the topic, a few works in the literature examine the subject in a systematic way. Likewise, project strategy has not yet become a first-class, widely used construct, and an integral element of current project management practices. Moreover, most of the existing ideas around project strategy focus on business and management aspects, such as the alignment of projects with corporate strategy and project success factors. Consequently, limited support is provided with respect to the implementation aspects of project strategy. The main goal of this article is to bridge this gap. Specifically, to achieve this goal, we first discuss and exemplify the significance of an explicit project strategy. Subsequently, following a relevant literature review, we put forward a methodological means, called the project strategy matrix, which can be applied to design, capture, communicate, and manage the concrete strategy of a project. Such means capitalize on and adapt Rumelt's seminal work on business strategy, in a more problem-solving-oriented approach that puts emphasis on the key challenges and constraints of projects. We employ a real-world scenario of an Information Technology project to illustrate the case, to support our argumentation and to exemplify the project strategy matrix. Moreover, based on practical experience in a number of projects using a collaborative practice research approach, we report relevant findings and provide insights on the way the project strategy matrix can be applied in the real world. Finally, we call for an intensification of research on the topic of project strategy and make concrete recommendations in this regard.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2019.2931147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809922","Engineering management;project management;project planning;project strategy;project success factors","Companies;Task analysis;Systematics;Planning;Project management;Bridges","knowledge management;organisational aspects;problem solving;project management","information technology project;project strategy matrix;explicit project strategy;project management practices;project strategy focus;corporate strategy;project success factors;concrete strategy;business strategy","","3","","32","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Over this period, the focus of applications, problems and consequently research themes has been changed dramatically. However, the main efforts have been arguably yielded to employ agile development in large and distributed environments. This imposes sophisticated needs to deal with e.g. project definition and management in such environments, as well as techniques and methods for communication, coordination, collaboration, etc., and even, the resulting cultural and organizational problems. This paper provides a systematic literature review in which main problems and themes of agile software development in large organizations, systems or projects and/or in distributed teams and environments have been sought and classified. The source of data is limited to IEEE publishing whether conferences or journals, and from 2005 onward. The results show that the major problems chronologically began with issues of cultural readiness, method implementation/adoption and project management, and then for the most recent years, the emphasis has been mainly switched to quality management as well as communication and collaboration mechanisms. Meanwhile, the results also reveal that indeed large organizations are even more eager and pioneer to transition to agile development due to their high degrees of cost as well as competitiveness. This fact paves the way to use their valuable, early experiences for other large as well as medium and small teams and organizations particularly those who have not switched yet. The study ends up with a few predictions for the future of agile development research themes in large and distributed environments.","","978-1-4799-5439-1","10.1109/MySec.2014.6986017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986017","Agile Software Development;Agile Methods;Large Organizations;Distributed Teams;Global Environments;Offshore Development;Systematic Literature Review","Conferences;Organizations;Software;Cultural differences;Collaboration;Global communication;Bibliographies","organisational aspects;project management;quality management;reviews;software prototyping","distributed environments;agile software development;data source;IEEE publishing;project management;quality management;large organizations;offshore development;literature review;cultural aspects","","11","","59","","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An approach to face this challenge is provided by the application of methods used for agile software development. These methods have helped the software industry for years to a measureable optimization of the success factors time, quality and costs. Referring to these successes, a method is developed which allows a systematic transmission of agile mechanisms of action towards development processes of technical products. In a first step, applied agile practices are identified and clustered to common so-called agile mechanisms of action.

How to contractualize the Agile production of software, especially for security & mission critical organizations, which typically outsource software projects, has been a major concern since the beginning of the “Agile Era.” In literature, little has been done, from a foundational point of view regarding the formalization of such contracts. Indeed, when the development is outsourced, the management of the contractual life is non-trivial. This happens because the interests of the two parties are typically not aligned. In these situations, software houses strive for the minimization of the effort, while the customer commonly expects high quality artifacts. This structural asymmetry can hardly be overcome with traditional “Waterfall” contracts. In this work, we propose a foundational approach to the Law & Economics of Agile contracts. Moreover, we explore the key elements of the Italian procurement law and outline a suitable solution to merge some basic legal constraints with Agile requirements. Finally, a case study is presented, describing how Agile contracting has been concretely implemented in the Italian Defense Acquisition Process. This work is intended to be a framework for Agile contracts for the Italian public sector of critical systems, according to the new contractual law (Codice degli Appalti).","","978-1-4503-5661-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445158","Software Engineering;Agile;Agile Contracts;Contracting;Law & Economics;Public Sector","Contracts;Software;Law;Economics;Biological system modeling;Mission critical systems;Software engineering","contracts;outsourcing;procurement;project management;software development management;software engineering;software houses;software prototyping","agile developments;mission critical systems;established software development paradigm;contracting issues;software consumer;software producer;security & mission critical organizations;software projects;software houses;traditional Waterfall contracts;Italian public sector","","","","42","","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Purpose: To understand how project managers and software engineers interpret their experiences in agile software projects considering the simplicity issues in agile software development. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with practitioners within a software development company. The data was analysed using grounded theory techniques. Results: A set of categories (lightweight process, knowledge acquisition, personal communication, time-consuming, and product with value) that affect the simplicity in agile software development were extracted. Finally, the categories and propositions with higher explanatory power were used to create a provisional theory about simplicity in agile software projects. Conclusion: The results show that a better understanding of the implications of simplicity on agile software development may contribute to the projects' successes.","","978-1-5386-2141-7","10.1109/SEAA.2017.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8051325","Simplicity;Agile Software Development;Qualitative Study","Software;Scrum (Software development);Interviews;Companies;Knowledge acquisition;Focusing","project management;software engineering;software management","agile software development;project managers;software engineers;agile software projects;semistructured interviews;software development company;grounded theory techniques;provisional theory","","3","","12","","28 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Requirements are elicited at the beginning of every software development process and project (product) and latter are prioritized according to their importance to the market and to the product itself. One of the most important and influencing steps while making a software product is requirements prioritization. Prioritizing requirements helps the software team to understand the existence and importance of a particular requirement, there are several requirements prioritization methodologies that aid in decision making but importantly many lacks to account the important factors that have significant influence in prioritizing requirements. We have proposed a requirement prioritization methodology based on several factors such as time to market, cost, risk etc. The proposed model is expected to overcome this lack. In (Scrum) sprints, requirements will be prioritized both on the basis of influencing factors such as cost, value, risk, time to market etc. and through the effect of non-functional requirements over functional requirements. This will improve the overall quality of software product when it is included in the development process of scrum. Requirements will not only be prioritized based on sprints, human decision but by critically analyzing the factors (sub characteristics) that can cause the product to success/ fail repeatedly thus ensuring the consistency in right requirements and hence the right prioritized requirements will be selected for a particular sprint at a time.","","978-1-5090-5984-3","10.1109/COMTECH.2017.8065749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8065749","Agile Software Engineering (ASE);Agile Software Development (ASD);Scrum;Product Owner (PO)","Software;Requirements engineering;Scrum (Software development);Stakeholders;Software engineering;Time to market","software engineering","innovative process;iterative process;software development process;software product;requirements prioritization methodologies;nonfunctional requirements;functional requirements;agile process;agile methodology;requirements elicitation;Scrum;software team;decision making","","7","","20","","12 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first phase describes a data collection performed on 8 agile teams in order to identify valuable aspects on managing an IW based on their experiences. We proposed a series of suggestions to the teams in order to improve their current context using their IW and we gathered the feedbacks. This process leds to a set of seven heuristics for managing an IW. On the second phase, in order to reinforce the heuristics validity, a five point Likert scale survey was applied resulting mostly in positive evaluations. At the end of these two phases, we associate the seven proposed heuristics, when possible, to available considerations on other agile community references.","","978-1-61284-426-8","10.1109/AGILE.2011.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005497","informative workspace;agile metrics;agile tracking","Measurement;Communities;Context;Software;Programming;Cognition;Humans","information management;software prototyping;team working","informative workspace management;data collection;feedback;agile method;team workspace;team adaptability;continuous reflection;workspace layout;human cognition;heuristics validity;five point Likert scale survey;agile community","","5","","8","","29 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their successful products immediately brought up the issue of adapting the methods also for large and distributed organizations engaged in projects to build major, complex products. Currently the most popular multi-teams agile method is the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) which, however, is subject to criticism: it appears to be quite demanding and expensive in terms of human resource and project management practices. Moreover, SAFe allegedly goes against some of the principles of agility. This research attempts to gather a deeper understanding of the matter first reviewing and analysing the studies published on this topic via a multivocal literature review and then with an extended empirical investigation on the matters that appear most controversial via the direct analysis of the work of 25 respondents from 17 different companies located in eight countries. Thus, the originality of this research is in the systemic assessment of the “level of flexibility” of SAFe, highlighting the challenges of adopting this framework as it relates to decision making, structure, and the technical and managerial competencies of the company. The results show that SAFe can be an effective and adequate approach if the company is ready to invest a significant effort and resources into it both in the form of providing time for SAFe to be properly absorbed and specific training for individuals.","","978-1-6654-9590-5","10.1109/ICSE-SEIP55303.2022.9794087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794087","Empirical software engineering;distributed agile;surveys","Training;Bibliographies;Decision making;Project management;Companies;Software;Software engineering","decision making;project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","SAFe;scaled agile framework;distributed organizations;human resource;project management practices;multivocal literature review;multiteams agile method","","","","67","IEEE","17 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Strong unit testing, to ensure correctness, including the satisfaction of timing constraints, is the foundation of the proposed methodology.

These opinions are important, since developers are highlytrained professionals whose beliefs would doubtless affect their practice. As in evidence-based medicine, disseminating empirical findings to developers is a key step in ensuring that the findings impact practice. In this paper, we describe a case study, on the prior beliefs of developers at Microsoft, and the relationship of these beliefs to actual empirical data on the projects in which these developers work. Our findings are that a) programmers do indeed have very strong beliefs on certain topics b) their beliefs are primarily formed based on personal experience, rather than on findings in empirical research and c) beliefs can vary with each project, but do not necessarily correspond with actual evidence in that project. Our findings suggest that more effort should be taken to disseminate empirical findings to developers and that more in-depth study the interplay of belief and evidence in software practice is needed.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-3900-1","10.1145/2884781.2884812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886896","Practitioner Belief;Empirical Evidence;Empirical Software Engineering.","Bayes methods;Software engineering;Software;Media;Computer science;Immune system","software engineering","empirical software engineering;Microsoft;empirical research;software practice","","43","","59","","3 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under the CE methodology, sequential tasks can only be performed as such. We introduce a method for starting sequential tasks concurrently using a pre-emptive approach. Where there are a, suitably small, finite number of possible alternative subsequent tasks, we propose that a more agile approach is to begin work on these alternative subsequent tasks concurrently to the preceding task, sharing the resource needed for the subsequent task amongst the different alternatives. Further, where the probability for each alternative task is known, we demonstrate that by setting the resource allocation equal to the probabilities of each outcome, it is possible dynamically allocate resources to minimise the expected completion of the overall project. A simple classically sequential two task case study is developed and analysed to illustrate this method. The paper concludes by revisiting the original assumptions and discussing how resource efficiency is traded off for minimising project completion time.","","978-0-86341-816-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286494","","","agile manufacturing;concurrent engineering;planning;resource allocation;scheduling","stochastic based preemptive planning;scheduling;concurrent engineering;CE methodology;agile approach;resource allocation","","","","","","8 Aug 2007","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Whereas classical Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) methodologies focus on models that are built from scratch with little support for reuse, Agile CDD is a reuse-focused development process in which an application is built incrementally by repeatedly reusing other existing concerns. In Agile CDD, a modeler would use a modelling language that is appropriate for the current development phase and for the problem domain. Model transformations would then be applied to produce the initial set of models for the next phase. The process will continue until an execute model is produced. In each phase, the modeller should consult a repository of reusable concerns to identify and reuse concerns. Changing requirements are welcome and incomplete implementations are moved to the next iteration by delaying design decisions.","","978-1-7281-3393-5","10.1109/ICSSP.2019.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812865","Agile;Software Process;Software Reuse;Model Driven Development","Unified modeling language;Software;Adaptation models;Authentication;Libraries;Analytical models;Tools","formal specification;object-oriented programming;project management;software architecture;software development management;software reusability","agile concern-driven development process;software development process;agile practices;reuse-focused development process;modeler;reusable concerns;model-driven engineering methodologies;model transformation;Agile CDD process","","2","","45","","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automotive software, developed in a traditional/legacy way, currently must be rewritten from scratch to support new features or modifications in associated hardware. Disruptive automotive megatrends: connectivity, electrification, and autonomous driving continue to demand new features in a complex software-base. As a result, greater quality issues are faced when more functionality is added to traditional, nonstandardized automotive software. Several researchers have proposed standardization of automotive software to improve the software quality. However, as yet, the industry lacks a de facto standard. At the heart of the AUTILE Framework, we recommend following automotive open system architecture standard as the basis to design modular and open software architecture. To further realize the benefits of modular software architecture designed in the first phase, AUTILE chooses and integrates Agile methodologies as its software development approach. Widespread adoption of Agile methodologies for automotive software development has not occurred and this research highlights the enablers and barriers in this domain.

To address the above problem I have first proposed a “Reference [1]” K model based Chameleon model (I choose peculiar name to highlight the model's main advantage of being able to adapt to the changing test cases requirement i.e. the tests cases are not hard coded but decided at run time) and further discussed over its implementation.","","978-1-4673-2177-8","10.1109/CONSEG.2012.6349516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6349516","Automation Framework for Agile Projects;Chameleon;Automation Framework for Dynamic Tests;K Model","Automation;Testing;XML;Adaptation models;Graphical user interfaces;Data models;Robustness","program testing;regression analysis;software prototyping","chameleon model based automation framework;agile environments;automated testing;regression testing;K model based chameleon model","","","","8","","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering wide range of benefits, automotive industry is also moving from traditional approaches towards agile practices for the development of automotive software's. The key challenges in automotive software are safety, complexity, user involvement, flexibility and innovation; which are difficult to handle by implementing traditional approaches. In order to overcome these challenges, it is essential to adopt such methods which should be flexible, fast with change management and user participation and can accomplish the automotive requirements and standards. Therefore, to accelerate the development process in automotive software there is a need to integrate agile development processes. This paper gives insights to the implementation of agile methods and to understand the effect of combined usage of agile processes and V model in the development of automotive software. This paper reveals that from both research and industrial perspective, it is still not clear how to combine two approaches i.e. agile methods and V model. The findings of this paper show that combined use of agile processes and V model in the development of automotive software is promising and there is a need to develop a significant approach that combines agile methods and V model for automotive software development.","","978-1-7281-8491-3","10.1109/CANDO-EPE51100.2020.9337750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9337750","Agile methods;automotive software development;V model;automotive domain","Industries;Technological innovation;Software;Safety;Task analysis;Standards;Automotive engineering","automobile industry;automotive engineering;management of change;software prototyping","automotive software development processes;automotive industry;automotive requirements;agile development processes;change management","","1","","17","","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most popular Agile software development approaches is Scrum which is widely adopted by the software industry and university curricula. Learning Agile Scrum is imperative for students not just as the part of the SE module but for use in the development of their final software project during the course. Teaching the Agile Scrum approach in a way that students can effectively employ in their final project requires the use of some additional practical aid, which is always a challenging task for teaching staff. Employing commercial tools may not be suitable due to additional financial cost, time and learning curve for students. This paper proposes an easy and effective Game-Based Learning (GBL) approach for Agile Scrum using Trello. Trello is a web- based app with no learning curve used to design any project in a collaborative environment. It is not a Scrum tool, nevertheless its features can be transmuted into a Scrum tool to be used to develop projects. Using this Trello-based gaming activity, students can learn the Agile Scrum approach as a game not as a complex methodology. This proposed GBL approach has been used for two undergraduate courses for the last four years, demonstrating constant improvement for both courses in their learning and assessment whilst comparing it with the traditional teaching approach for Agile Scrum.","2325-4289","978-1-7281-1884-0","10.1109/CIG.2019.8848104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8848104","","Scrum (Software development);Software;Task analysis;Tools;Games;Education;Collaboration","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;groupware;Internet;mobile computing;project management;software prototyping;teaching","software industry;computing degree courses;Trello-based gaming activity;agile scrum software development;software engineering curricula;software project;game-based learning;teaching;gamification;university curricula;Web-based app;undergraduate courses;collaborative working","","11","","15","","26 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are so many models available today that an organization can use for developing a software but considering the dynamics of today s world where technology is changing at a fast pace and innovative products are hitting the market at great speed, these organizations do not want a software development model that consume lot of time and efforts, and hence most of the business houses are moving towards Agile approach for software development. With this change in approach for software development, the big question is that how to ensure Quality of product developed using Agile model. The traditional approach has a separate phase for testing a software product which ensures that an independent team has validated the product per specified requirements. However, with Agile way of software development, this leverage of involvement of independent test teams and test levels has taken a back. This paper, will highlight broadly the role of QA within Agile development model, with focus on fresh thoughts and approaches to improve the overall quality of product developed using Agile methodology.

These practices are usually supported by empirical team approaches, implying taking risks that can cost development resources. The adoption of data analytics within the business world has gained relevance in recent years, since through this it is possible to process data for decision-making based on predictive models. Today these models are used based on the management and processing of historical data, using data analytics and artificial intelligence techniques. Taking advantage of the fact that software project managers publicly offer Datasets with information on their Sprints and their characteristics, these could be used with data analytics, in conjunction with supervised learning models, both prediction and classification to support a more efficient decision making, thereby achieving an improvement in the process with a more efficient use of resources.","2332-5712","978-1-6654-2612-1","10.1109/ENC53357.2021.9534800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534800","data analytics;Scrum;decision making;retrospective;artificial intelligence;supervised learning;prediction;classification","Analytical models;Data analysis;Decision making;Supervised learning;Predictive models;Inspection;Data models","artificial intelligence;data analysis;decision making;project management;software development management;software prototyping;supervised learning;team working","data analytics techniques;retrospective stage;agile Scrum methodology;Scrum retrospective;future Sprints;frequent inspection;adaptation processes;current Sprint;team velocity;empirical team approaches;process data;decision-making;predictive models;historical data;artificial intelligence techniques;efficient decision making;related tasks","","","","0","","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This growth depends on the response time that companies today provide users; many of them operate their logistics management manually and traditionally, which leads to delays in service and dissatisfaction of both the external and internal clients. Likewise, companies in the sector, by working traditionally, do not use technology as a point of competitiveness within the market, since 60% of companies use software for their operations. To do this, an agile logistics management model is proposed that will consist of reducing purchase order attention time by 50% and improving internal processes and procedures under the Lean Service methodology.

In this paper, we propose a software metrics plan (SMP) containing different software metrics to manage software processes during ERP implementation. Two hypotheses have been formulated and tested using statistical techniques to validate the SMP.

Method: A case study, based on Grounded Theory evaluation of interviews and direct observation of three agile teams; one having separate testers, two without. All teams perform long-term development of parts of e-business web portals. Results: Teams without testers use a quality experience work mode centered around a tight field-use feedback loop, driven by a feeling of responsibility, supported by test automation, resulting in frequent deployments. Conclusion: In the given domain, hand-overs to separate testers appear to hamper the feedback loop more than they contribute to quality, so working without testers is preferred.

However, one of the problems is that, usually, students are not prepared to manage and to be managed. This situation causes higher effort waste and is time-consuming. Additionally, the quality is decreased due to poor self-management and inadequate division of activities. Such problems can be minimized if there is a management policy that provides a wider vision of the project's course, allowing the problems to be anticipated in such a way as to correct the flaws as soon as possible. This work proposes the adaptation of the SCRUM Agile Project Management Methodology in the context of the development of academic projects, both in undergraduate and graduate courses, where students are organized in small teams and execute the project in a systematic way. This method was applied during the practical part of the ¿real-time systems¿ course, whose project was the development of an automated industrial production line with robot arms, using the LEGO NXT robotic kit. Therefore, this paper will show implementation aspects of the proposed method, difficulties and solutions, which parts of Scrum were effectively adopted and, specially, the learnt lessons.","2377-634X","978-1-4244-4715-2","10.1109/FIE.2009.5350404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5350404","SCRUM;Agile Methodology;Academic Projects;Real Time Systems","Project management;Real time systems;Service robots;Educational robots;Robotics and automation;Proposals;Productivity;Defense industry;Production systems;Manipulators","computer science education;continuing education;educational courses;project management;real-time systems;software development management","project development;knowledge consolidation;management policy;SCRUM agile project management methodology;academic project;undergraduate course;real-time system course;automated industrial production line;LEGO NXT robotic kit","","10","","14","","8 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Agile way of BI implementation","B. Rehani","Business Intelligence -Technology excellence Group, Tata Consultancy services","2011 Annual IEEE India Conference","26 Jan 2012","2011","","","1","6","The rapidly changing IT economy has influenced the Business Intelligence (BI) systems to look at innovative ways to be equally fast and flexible. There is a need to be more intuitive and quick in implementation so as to adapt to the changing environment. One of the ways by which organizations can achieve these goals is by using Agile based BI development models. There are many components in a successful BI solution which include data integration, analytics, data quality, metadata management, enterprise data warehouse, dashboards and so on. Each of these components are critical for an organization, and stakeholders are ready to invest in these. The only issue is how quickly we can provide these solutions and how flexible these solutions are with the changing demands. Traditionally, we have been using the waterfall SDLC model for BI implementations which encourages getting requirements clarity in the initial phases of the projects and having distinct deliverables for each phase. With time the approach has been customized and enhanced to `iterative waterfall approach' where a chunk of requirements is implemented in one SDLC cycle. Though this approach has been successful in the past, the BI practitioners recognize that business requirements are not static and we must be able to effectively mould the deliverables based on changing requirements. Hence, we cannot continue with the Waterfall (or Iterative waterfall) project management approach that is neither fast nor flexible. Applying the concepts of agile development to BI is the intuitive way forward. The aim of this paper is to provide a background on agile project management & development techniques, and suggest some guidelines and best practices which can help in successful Agile BI implementations.","2325-9418","978-1-4577-1109-1","10.1109/INDCON.2011.6139618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6139618","Agile;Buisness Intelligence;Scrum;Development methodlogy","Bismuth;Business;Testing;Software;Data models;Programming;Data warehouses","competitive intelligence;data analysis;data warehouses;meta data;software engineering","BI system;business intelligence;IT economy;information technology;Agile based BI development model;data integration;data analytics;data quality;metadata management;enterprise data warehouse;dashboard;waterfall SDLC model;iterative waterfall project management;agile project management;agile project development;systems development life cycle","","1","","4","","26 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At this point, the model of Trustworthy Scrum (TS) comes to prominence by enabling the security activities to cooperate with the agile methods and to work in Scrum framework. In this study, a statistical analysis related to the feasibility of the Trustworthy Scrum model was conducted in order to analyze this mismatch based on scientific evidence.","","978-1-7281-3964-7","10.1109/UBMK.2019.8907213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8907213","Secure software development;Agile methodolo-gies;Scrum","","project management;security of data;software development management;software prototyping;software quality","software developers;intended software product;cost constraints;software projects;security oriented software development process;cost criteria;conventional software development;agile software development processes;agile methods;Scrum framework;trustworthy scrum model","","","","28","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A combined use of User-Centered Design and Lean Startup with Agile Development has been pointed out as a means to minimize these challenges. Aims: This paper aimed to characterize how a transformation to such combined approach takes place in a multinational company, as well as to point out benefits and challenges to undergo such transformation. Method: We performed a multiple case study. We collected data through semi-structured interviews, focus group session, questionnaire and observations. Results: Our study revealed two major strategies to conduct the transformation: to create a dedicated Transformation Team to lead it and to make a Transformation Package Toolkit available to team members. Also, introducing a Product Designer role to a cross-functional team and using experimentation are among the most important benefits. Managerial mindset change and team autonomy are among the most concerning challenges. Conclusions: Our results bring implications to industry practitioners: organizational and cultural changes involve role and responsibilities definitions, introduction of new working processes, and are dependent upon user engagement and managerial support. These sound paramount to organizations that aim to succeed in this yet-to-be-further-understood transformation.","1949-3789","978-1-7281-2968-6","10.1109/ESEM.2019.8870154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870154","Agile Development;User-Centered Design;Lean Startup;Agile Transformation;Case Study","Software;User centered design;Training;Companies;Interviews;Cultural differences","product design;project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working;user centred design","user engagement;user-centered design;lean startup;software development;agile transformation;user involvement;cross-functional team;team autonomy;product designer role;transformation package toolkit;agile development;multinational company;managerial support","","10","","17","","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, traditional project management methodologies advocate formal planning as an essential process in any project. However, alternative recent project management methodologies (e.g., Agile) promote less focus on a formal planning process at the start of a project. In this article, we question when formal planning is effective, when it is counterproductive, and which planning approach (strategic or tactical) is more effective for various project risk levels and performance dimensions (efficiency and effectiveness). Results from analyzing 2002 projects suggest that strategic planning has a higher value than tactical planning. Furthermore, tactical planning has a negative impact on project efficiency in low-risk projects as it increases project duration and cost but adds little value. In practice, in low-risk projects, managers may limit their focus on counterproductive tactical practices, such as risk, and procurement planning, and focus instead on long-term strategic planning, such as human resources planning. Theoretically, this article sets boundaries of effectiveness for planning-performance theory and advances the literature on the planning fallacy.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3053585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354350","Project management;project planning;risk","Planning;Project management;Strategic planning;Organizations;Monitoring;Decision making;Australia","","","","1","","","IEEE","15 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Based on a Grounded Theory study of 31 agile practitioners drawn from 18 teams across five countries, we present a grounded theory of becoming agile as a network of on-going transitions across five dimensions: software development practices, team practices, management approach, reflective practices, and culture. The unique position of a software team through this network, and their pace of progress along the five dimensions, explains why individual agile teams present distinct manifestations of agility and unique transition experiences. The theory expands the current understanding of agility as a holistic and complex network of on-going multidimensional transitions, and will help software teams, their managers, and organizations better navigate their individual agile journeys.","1558-1225","978-1-5386-3868-2","10.1109/ICSE.2017.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7985657","agile software development;transition;selforganizing;teams;management;culture;theory;grounded theory","Software;Interviews;Telecommunications;Banking;Encoding;Finance","cultural aspects;software development management;software prototyping;team working","agile development practices;grounded theory;software development practices;team practices;management approach;reflective practices;culture;software team","","48","","44","","20 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Systematic institutionalized Scrum across all projects and used data driven tools like story process efficiency to surface product backlog impediments. This allowed them to systematically develop a strategy for a second doubling in productivity. Two teams have achieved a sustainable quadrupling of productivity compared to waterfall projects. We discuss here the strategy to bring the entire company to that level.

Moreover, the agile approach also helps in business to address the problem of unpredictability. Scrum is the most commonly used agile method applied to the projects having fast changing requirements. Development in this method is implemented through a series of iterations known as sprints. The current study provides insight into the impact of the agile framework using Scrum on the deliverables as compared to the Iterative Enhancement Model (IEM). In this study, same product is developed using Scrum methods as well as IEM Method and various metrics were used to compare both the products such as the stage of software development life cycle (SDLC) when the defect was identified, number of defects identified, time when the defects were identified, number of change requests received, time when the error got detected and the features rolled out using both methods. All these metrics are carefully selected as they are significant while analyzing the maintainability of any given software. It clearly emerges that agile methodology encourages better planning due to the customer involvement thus more amenable to accommodate the desired changes easily. Agile methodology is also beneficial as it overtly emphasizes on highly interactive and frequent communication between developers and customers. This method also ensures dynamic development and facilitates quick delivery with a scope of continuous enhancement because the product is very flexible in nature.

This is one of the reasons why organizations are increasingly adopting the Agile methodology. Agile has been one approach organizations adopt to effectively response to this current technological competitiveness because through Agile organizations are able to build constant, quality software that allows them to get their products and services quickly in the market while being flexible and adaptive to the continuous change. However, with the adoption of Agile comes numerous challenges, that includes various misconceptions about Agile which often hinders effective implementation of Agile projects. This paper reviews the current literature on various misconceptions around the agile methodology and how they impact the organizations technology competitiveness. A systematic literature review was conducted on two theories; first being the current misconceptions around Agile approach and secondly, the organizations technology competitiveness. The main aim of the review was to establish a connection between the existence of misconceptions in Agile environments and the impact towards the organization ability to effective technology competitiveness.","","978-1-7281-0040-1","10.1109/IMITEC45504.2019.9015875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9015875","Agile;Misconceptions;Technology competitiveness","Organizations;Software;Planning;Technological innovation;Stakeholders;Adaptation models","management of change;organisational aspects;project management;software development management;software prototyping;software quality","digital IR transformation;organization technology competitiveness;effective technology competitiveness;organization ability;agile methodology;4IR transformation","","","","46","","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet in many IT development projects, bewilderment remains as to how to express business value in process decisions and the delivered system. Also, projects continue to implement functionality that's off the mark or never used. This situation occurs because there isn't sufficient methodological support to determine and monitor business value or to link business value decisions to the development project's mechanics.

Current practice relies on expert judgment, where the accuracy of estimates is sensitive to the expertise of practitioners and prone to bias. In order to improve the effectiveness of the effort estimation process, the goal of this research is to investigate and understand the estimation process with respect to its accuracy in the context of agile software development from the perspective of agile development teams. Using case study research, two observations and eleven interviews were conducted with three agile development teams at SAP SE, a German multinational software corporation. The results reveal that factors such as the developer's knowledge and experience and the complexity and impact of changes on the underlying system affect the magnitude as well as the accuracy of estimation. Moreover, if certain aspects of the estimation process, such as the potential impact of a change on the underlying system, are supported by a tool can help improve estimation accuracy. We conclude that explicit consideration of these factors in the estimation process can support experts in making accurate and informed estimates. Furthermore, there is a need for a tool that incorporates expert knowledge, enables explicit consideration of cost drivers by experts and visualizes this information in order to improve the effectiveness of the effort estimation process.","","978-1-4503-4188-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7831574","Effort estimation;agile development;change impact","Estimation;Software;Context;Planning;Agile software development;Companies","human factors;software cost estimation;software prototyping","developer experience;developer knowledge;effort estimation;agile software development","","","","22","","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With respect to these factors, and increasing growth of applying chaos and complex system theories in organizational study and strategic management, this research attempts to design a framework for managing agile projects based on these two theories. Concepts of these theories will be a lens to investigate software project management and propose new practices. Our analyses indicate that chaos theory can further shape strategic decisions in comparison to complex system concepts that can further help designing an appropriate agile team in the level of people interaction.","","978-0-7695-3602-6","10.1109/ECBS.2009.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4839256","software development management;project management;chaos theory;complex adaptive systems;agile methods","Chaos;Project management;Power system management;Adaptive systems;Bifurcation;Innovation management;Fractals;Open systems;Uncertainty;Humans","chaos;project management;software management","agile management;complex system theories;chaos;software project management;agile methods;organizational study;strategic management","","3","","8","","24 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile methods aim at reducing these uncertainties through a balancing of predictive work (e.g. information gathering, forecasting, planning) and adaptive work (e.g. prototyping, trial-and-error, validated learning). However, companies often fail at successfully conducting predictive work in order to avoid uncertainties in the product development process. Methods for forecasting and information generation have to date not been described in the context of agile new product development.

Two tangible artefacts that carry information about the team's work are the index cards which capture stories and tasks to be implemented and the wall where they are displayed (which we refer to as the 'Wall'). It is widely acknowledged that these are key elements supporting the work of the XP team, but no systematic investigation of their role has been reported to date.

Iterative experimentation is needed to address the inherent complexities of data collection and preparation, model entanglement, and the technical debt of machine learning. The complexity of this process is compounded due to dependencies on the production environment and real- time data. We propose a unified framework which facilitates the planning, development, and deployment of a machine learning application through parallel processes for software and machine learning engineering. This allows for the risk of both the project and machine learning development to be significantly reduced through continuous integration, evaluation, and production. The framework, named MLASDLC, unifies concepts from standard software development life cycle methodologies (SDLC), development operations (DevOps) and machine learning operations (MLOps) to present a framework for the development of machine learning applications.","","978-1-6654-0655-0","10.1109/SLAAI-ICAI54477.2021.9664736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664736","Machine learning;MLOps;DevOps;agile;SDLC;software development life cycle;experimentation;data-centric","Agile software development;Machine learning;Production;Data collection;Software;Data models;Complexity theory","computer aided instruction;learning (artificial intelligence);project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;software quality","model entanglement;standard software development life cycle methodologies;development operations;agile software development life cycle model;machine learning application development;software development teams;aligning machine learning production;standard software development processes","","","","28","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results indicate that Sprint Planning includes decisions about planning the work for the subsequent sprint, Sprint Execution includes tactical implementation and development decisions, Sprint Review includes decisions about whether the product satisfies the customer and whether future sprints should continue, and Sprint Retrospective includes decisions for improving the sprint process in future sprints. Additionally, six key obstacles to decision making were identified.

Due to the inter-relationship between agile methods and architecture, as well as divergent perceptions on their correlation stated in numerous sources, we are motivated to find out how these perceptions are supported by findings in the research community in general and in empirical studies in particular. To fully benefit from agile practices and architectural disciplines, we need empirical data on the perceived and experienced impacts of introducing agile methods to existing software development process, as well as correlations between agile and architecture. In this paper, we survey the research literature for statements made regarding the relationship between agile development and software architecture. The main findings are that there is a lack of scientific support for many of the claims that are concerned with agile and architecture, and more empirical studies are needed to fully reveal the benefits and drawbacks implied by an agile software development method.","","978-1-4244-7788-3","10.1109/ICSEA.2010.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615620","Agile;Agile methodology;Architecture","Computer architecture;Software architecture;Programming;Software;Data mining;Conferences","software architecture;software prototyping","software development;rapid development;flexible development;agile development;software architecture","","14","","44","","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, agile methods lack a formal approach to risks management. Therefore, in this paper we integrate risk management process in Scrum framework, which is one of the widely used agile method. The integration of risk management with Scrum framework is validated through a controlled experiment performed on undergraduate students. The results of the experiment showed critical risks being identified in later sprints and gross risk value for project increasing if risks not mitigated. This showed that an iterative risk management process integrated in Scrum framework may lead to successful projects with lesser failures.","2334-3141","978-1-5386-9355-1","10.1109/FIT.2018.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8616984","Agile methodology;Risk Management;Scrum framework","Risk management;Software;Registers;Planning;Process control;Project management;Software engineering","project management;risk management;software development management;software prototyping","iterative risk management process;agile methods;agile based distributed environments;risks management;project management activities;Scrum framework","","8","","21","","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The value of ERP Implementation Strategy has been stressed over the years and it has been included as an important Critical Success Factor, CSF, as recorded by previous researchers. Traditional ERP implementation followed more or less a sequential approach akin to the Waterfall Model. Researchers over the years have categorized ERP Implementation methodology and developed frameworks. These are based on varied ERP Implementation observations. Given the variety of methodologies and frameworks available, the real-world ERP implementation demands the development and adoption of a strategy as a guiding principle for underlying methods. This paper suggests a new classification approach based on the ERP implementation strategy that can be categorized as custom-made, vendor-specific or consultant-specific. This research paper also conducts a comparative study of leading vendor-specific ERP implementation methodologies along-with their example cases.

When I joined the company there was already a Selenium-based test framework in place, but there were only a couple of automated test cases created; we had about 400 test steps, or individual assertions about the behavior of the application. When I left Socialtext two years later, we had just surpassed 10,000 test steps in the main set of regression tests. We also had browser-specific test sets in place, an automated test case for visually checking the application, and a Continuous-Integration-like script that ran all day and all night against the latest version of the code. At about 4000 test steps, regression bugs released to production dropped essentially to zero. The other 6000 test steps covered ongoing new features in the project, and more robust testing of the older application functions. This report discusses how I helped grow this system, and the things we learned along the way that helped it be such a successful ongoing project. The report covers initial conditions and test design; discusses issues in application feature coverage; how and when to grow the system quickly; a couple of test design smells that caused us problems along the way; how we treat Continuous Integration in a system like this; and how we coped when significant parts of the User Interface were completely re-engineered.","","978-0-7695-3768-9","10.1109/AGILE.2009.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5261058","UI automation;Selenium;test design;experience","History;Automatic testing;System testing;Quality management;Failure analysis;User interfaces;Engineering profession;Home automation;Radio access networks;Computer bugs","program testing;regression analysis","large test automation project;selenium;Socialtext;regression tests;browser specific test sets;continuous-integration-like script;robust testing;application function;application feature coverage;test design;continuous integration;user interface","","6","","","","25 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While conventional Agile methods are not generally applicable to large multi-year and mission-critical systems, Agile hybrids are now being developed (such as SAFe) to exploit the productivity improvements of Agile while retaining the necessary process rigor and coordination needs of these projects. From the perspective of Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V), however, the adoption of these hybrid Agile frameworks is becoming problematic. Hence, we find it prudent to question the compatibility of conventional IV&V techniques with (hybrid) Agile practices. This paper documents our investigation of (a) relevant literature, (b) the modification and adoption of Agile frameworks to accommodate the development of large scale, mission critical systems, and (c) the compatibility of standard IV&V techniques within hybrid Agile development frameworks. Specific to the latter, we found that the IV&V methods employed within a hybrid Agile process can be divided into three groups: (1) early lifecycle IV&V techniques that are fully compatible with the hybrid lifecycles, (2) IV&V techniques that focus on tracing requirements, test objectives, etc. are somewhat incompatible, but can be tailored with a modest effort, and (3) IV&V techniques involving an assessment requiring artifact completeness that are simply not compatible with hybrid Agile processes, e.g., those that assume complete requirement specification early in the development lifecycle.","2472-9647","978-1-5090-4623-2","10.1109/SYSCON.2017.7934770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7934770","Independent Verification and Validation;Agile","Software;Mission critical systems;Standards;Portfolios;Computer architecture;Documentation;Bibliographies","program verification;software prototyping","standard independent verification and validation;IV&V techniques;agile framework;compatibility issue;standard management and execution approach;small-scale software development projects;agile hybrids;hybrid agile process;hybrid lifecycles;tracing requirements","","4","","17","","29 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our findings indicate that while prototyping can help with some challenges of agile RE such as lack of documentation, motivation for RE work and poor quality communication, it also needs complementary practices to reach its full potential.

Because of the underlying philosophy of agile, agile teams are paying more attention to communication that is mostly applicable for collocated teams. Most of the companies that apply distributed development, adopted agile software methodology into their software development lifecycle to reduce temporal, geographical and socio-cultural distance challenges. Regarding this, DSD brings along various challenges to be conducted by the distributed development team and also difficulties to apply agile practices at different locations. In this paper, the findings from a case study on geographical challenges in three small, one medium and one large distributed agile software development projects are presented. The empirical investigation with twelve people was done at one German-based global company that operates more than twenty countries.

This could be due to its features of concentrating more on delivering a working software rather than being presented with a bulk-load of documentation; rapid response to changes in requirements rather than following a prescribed plan; collaboration with customers rather than negotiation of contracts and giving more preference to individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Over the years, Agile approach (AA) has been perceived to be incompatible with distributed software development. However, recent studies have shown that Scrum, one of the popular Agile approaches, has been adopted and customized by organisations in alignment with distributed software development projects. This study presents the possibilities of adopting Scrum practices as an Agile approach in distributed software development projects based on different studies and reports that have been carried out in DSD projects using Scrum. Findings were presented from different studies showing Scrum being adopted successfully in DSD. The paper also investigated different ways in which these Scrum practices have been successfully adopted, thereby examining innovative approaches to Scrum practices, such as daily Scrum meetings, sprints, Scrum-of-Scrum and backlogs.","","978-1-5386-3831-6","10.1109/NEXTCOMP.2017.8016173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8016173","Distributed software development;Agile development;Scrum","Software;Scrum (Software development);Interviews;Companies;Collaboration;Information systems;Tools","project management;reviews;software development management;software prototyping","agile approach;literature review;agile software development;functional software development goals;customer collaboration;distributed software development project;Scrum practices;daily Scrum meetings;Scrum-of-Scrum;backlogs","","6","","13","","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this methodology often considers Functional Requirements (FRs) due to the nature of agile software development and strongly neglects Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs). Neglecting NFRs has negative impacts on software products that have resulted in poor quality and higher cost to fix problems in later stages of software development. This research proposes a study to effectively gather NFRs metadata from software requirement artifacts such as documents and images. This will be accomplished by reducing false positives to include NFRs in the early stages of software requirements gathering along with FRs. In addition, this study will use historical trending to predict additional NFRs that are overlooked by architects and can be included along with FRs in the early stages of agile software development. Furthermore, prioritization of NFRs using existing FRs methodologies is important to stakeholders as well as software engineers in delivering quality software. This research builds on prior studies by specifically focusing on NFRs during the early stages of agile software development. The goal of this study is to improve upon prior studies of NFRs in order to provide effective techniques to prioritize and predict NFRs during the early stages of agile software development and the impacts that NFRs have on the software development process.","1558-058X","978-1-4673-7300-5","10.1109/SECON.2015.7133007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133007","agile software engineering;CEPP;non-functional requirements;NFRM;PNFRM","Visualization;Agile software development;Security;Software engineering;Optical character recognition software;Unified modeling language","meta data;software prototyping;software quality","capturing eliciting predicting-and-prioritizing;CEPP;agile software development process;nonfunctional requirement metadata;software products;NFR metadata;software requirement;software quality","","11","","34","","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An Agile team estimates the effort of a task based on the available information which is usually conveyed through documentation. However, as documentation has a lower priority in Agile, little is known about how documentation effort can be optimized while achieving accurate estimation. Hence, to help practitioners achieve just-enough documentation for effort estimation, we investigated the different types of documented information that practitioners considered useful for effort estimation. We conducted a survey study with 121 Agile practitioners across 25 countries. Our survey results showed that (1) despite the lower priority of documentation in Agile practices, 98% of the respondents considered documented information moderately to extremely important when estimating effort, (2) 73% of them reported that they would re-estimate a task when the documented information was changed, and (3) functional requirements, user stories, definition of done, UI wireframes, acceptance criteria, and task dependencies were ranked as the most useful types of documented information for effort estimation. Nevertheless, many respondents reported that these useful types of documented information were occasionally changing or missing. Based on our study results, we provide recommendations for agile practitioners on how effort estimation can be improved by focusing on just-enough documentation.","2576-3148","978-1-6654-2882-8","10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609208","Effort Estimation;Agile;Story Points;Documentation","Software maintenance;Conferences;Estimation;Focusing;Documentation;Maintenance engineering;Frequency estimation","project management;software development management;software prototyping","Agile effort estimation;Agile iterative development;documentation effort;documented information;121 Agile practitioners;extremely important when estimating effort","","2","","53","","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The degree of project's complexity changes over its life cycle phases, where the uncertainty might be considered as highest at the initial phase with the tendency to reduce as information gathers over time. Within the paper different project management approaches are presented, emphasizing the difference among them and their sensitivity to uncertainties and projects characteristics. The traditional approach is suitable for managing well-structured projects in the project environment with clear requirements and project scope. But, stakeholders cannot always specify all the requirements at the very beginning of the project and changes throughout the project life cycle can be expected. Agile project management is most appropriate for managing projects with expected frequently changes throughout the project life cycle and related to that high uncertainty. For managing projects with not clearly defined goals and solutions, which are high-risk and high-change projects, with high failure rates, possible option might be extreme project management. In the situation when a project has clear solution but not clearly defined goals, emertxe project management could be best project management approach. The requirements of project management could be developed during the project life cycle, depending on different characteristics of project life cycle phases.

Specialist knowledge inhibits self-organization and role interchangeability which are key elements of agile development. Knowing that bureaucracies are hard to counteract once established, how can development of general knowledge in software organizations be improved? Job rotation is a well-known practice often used to improve general knowledge. The reported action research evaluated job rotation among developers in customer support. The findings suggest that general knowledge is considered interesting and valuable among the participants. However, the findings also show that general knowledge acquisition can be found irrelevant and therefore counter-efficient for day-to-day work among participants if the perceived applicability to own projects is too low. Therefore, using job rotation to improve general knowledge requires careful considerations. Implications for research and practice are discussed.","","978-0-7695-3768-9","10.1109/AGILE.2009.69","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5261107","Agile methods;adoption of agile methods;agile organizations;job rotation;organizational learning","Multiskilling;Java;Programming;Software safety;Application software;Software engineering;Occupational safety;Security;History;Knowledge acquisition","knowledge management;multiskilling;organisational aspects;software development management","agile software organization;job rotation;customer support;knowledge specialization;self-organization;role interchangeability;agile development;knowledge acquisition","","4","","34","","25 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the inception of the Agile Manifesto over ten years ago, agile development techniques have superseded waterfall methods in many, if not most, software development organizations. Despite its apparent success, many companies have struggled with the adoption and implementation of agile, and exactly what level of adoption provides the most agility. Agility is commonly held in the literature to be constructed of elements external to a company or project but may in fact be composed of both external and internal elements. The exact relationship of the adoption of agile development techniques and their relationship to the actual agility of a business remain unclear. A primary contributor to this uncertainty is the somewhat amorphous definition of agile itself. In academic literature, the concept is still relatively young and loosely defined. In practice, organizations have largely opted for a hybrid approach to agile, mixing its concepts and methods with existing Stage Gate or waterfall methodologies. This has made the management of agile even more complex. Crucially, there is no definition or criterion available to determine the appropriate mix of agile and waterfall processes in an embedded software development context nor is there a method to determine the impact of one against the other. This paper examines the results of an interpretive case study as to how stakeholders manage both market and process agility in an embedded systems context via a hybrid agility implementation and product genesis to achieve “true agility”. Thus, we provide the notion of agile vorticity, as the point at which market and process agility collide to produce business momentum at a specific point of innovation within the agile business vortex.","","978-1-5090-1114-8","10.1109/TEMSCON.2017.7998361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7998361","agile;agility;vorticity;scrum;management","Companies;Embedded systems;Information systems;Microprogramming","software development management;software houses;software prototyping","metagility;new product development;agile manifesto;agile development techniques;external elements;internal elements;stage gate;waterfall methodologies;agile management;embedded software development context;hybrid agility implementation;product genesis;business momentum;agile business vortex;software development management","","","","15","","3 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ISM approach starts with an identification of attributes, which are relevant to the problem or issue. Having decided the contextual relation, a structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM) is developed based on pairwise comparison of variables. Which is then converted into a reachability matrix (RM) and its transitivity is checked. It is necessary to analyze the performance of the various attributes for their operative applications in the execution of software development process.

There was a clear need to create excitement around the adoption and scaling of Scrum within the application development group. This led us to develop what we called ‘The Amazing Team Race.’ This experience report is about how an agile transition team used a team-based approach for creating excitement while scaling Scrum in a globally distributed organization.","","978-0-7695-3768-9","10.1109/AGILE.2009.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5261094","Agile;Team;Adoption;Amzaing Team Race","Contracts;Programming;Application software;Project management;Auditory system;Companies;Software performance;Software quality","software development management;team working","The Amazing Team Race;team based agile adoption;agile software development approach;Scrum;waterfall-style approach","","6","","3","","25 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our research hypothesis is that modifications to agile software development based on inspirations from mission command can improve the software engineering process in terms of planning, prioritizing, and communication of software requirements and progress, as well as improving the overall software product. Targeted Scrum is a modification of Traditional Scrum based on three inspirations from Mission Command: End State, Line of Effort, and Targeting. These inspirations have led to the introduction of the Product Design Meeting and modifications of some current Scrum meetings and artifacts. We tested our research hypothesis using a semester-long undergraduate level software engineering class. Students developed two software projects, one using Traditional Scrum and the other using Targeted Scrum. We then assessed how well both methodologies assisted the software development teams in planning and developing the software architecture, prioritizing requirements, and communicating progress. We also evaluated the software product produced by both methodologies. We found that Targeted Scrum did better in assisting the software development teams in the planning and prioritization of the requirements. However, Targeted Scrum had a negligible effect on improving the software development teams external and internal communications. Finally, Targeted Scrum did not have an impact on the product quality by the top performing and worst performing teams. Targeted Scrum did assist the product quality of the teams in the middle of the performance spectrum.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2015.2489654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296686","Scrum, Mission Command;Line of Effort;Product Design Meeting;Agile;Empirical Software Engineering;Scrum;mission command;line of effort;product design meeting;agile;empirical software engineering","Software;Planning;Scrum (Software development);Product design;Software engineering;Force","software architecture;software prototyping","targeted Scrum;mission command;agile software development;software engineering;software requirements;software product improvement;end state;line of effort;targeting;product design meeting;software projects;traditional Scrum;software architecture;product quality;performance spectrum","","11","","34","IEEE","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the context of agile software development (ASD), where the main objective is the fast delivery of functionalities, QRs are often ill-defined and not well addressed during the development process. Software analytics tools help to control quality though the measurement of quality-related software aspects to support decision-makers in the process of QR management. Aim: The goal of this research is to explore the benefits of integrating a concrete software analytics tool, Q-Rapids Tool, to assess software quality and support QR management processes. Method: In the context of a technology transfer project, the Softeam company has integrated Q-Rapids Tool in their development process. We conducted a series of workshops involving Softeam members working in the Modelio product development. Results: We present the Quality Feedback Loop (QFL) process to be integrated in software development processes to control the complete QR life-cycle, from elicitation to validation. As a result of the implementation of QFL in Softeam, Modelio's team members highlight the benefits of integrating a data analytics tool with their project planning tool and the fact that project managers can control the whole process making the final decisions. Conclusions: Practitioners can benefit from the integration of software analytics tools as part of their software development toolchain to control software quality. The implementation of QFL promotes quality in the organization and the integration of software analytics and project planning tools also improves the communication between teams.","","978-1-6654-0139-5","10.1109/ICSE-SEIS52602.2021.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402163","Quality Management Process, Quality Requirement, Quality Assessment, Software Analytics Tool, Quality Monitoring, Requirements Pattern","Feedback loop;Process control;Tools;Data models;Quality assessment;Planning;Monitoring","data analysis;decision making;product development;project management;software engineering;software prototyping;software quality;software tools","data-driven Feedback Loop;manage Quality;agile development;Quality requirements;QRs;system qualities;software projects;agile software development;software analytics tools;quality-related software aspects;concrete software analytics tool;Q-Rapids Tool;software quality;support QR management processes;technology transfer project;Modelio product development;Quality Feedback Loop process;QFL;software development processes;complete QR life-cycle;data analytics tool;project managers;software development toolchain;project planning tools","","","","13","","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile practices are designed specifically to address this challenge while showing early and continuous progress towards project goals. Applying an agile approach allows stakeholders to adapt the scope and capabilities of a development release to changing market needs. More recently, an agile approach has been recommended for developing the architecture of software systems, enabling the design to support current requirements and early releases while evolving to meet future expectations. Our experience defining emergent software systems to build a product line architecture for advanced data analytics demonstrates the benefits that can be gained from prioritizing work activities and delaying architecture decisions. This paper proposes a process and ontology for agile architecture development. Only the necessary aspects for each evolutionary release are designed and prototyped, as determined by expectations of the identified application domain scenarios.

However, in recent decades a series of methodologies have emerged, called ""agile methodologies"", which aim to develop software quickly, focusing on people and frequent delivery of software. Of the existing agile methodologies, Scrum is one of the most widely-applied, due to its ability to complement other methods and processes. For this reason, the strategies proposed by Scrum may be suitable for the distributed management and deployment of the phases and disciplines of RUP.

This research is based on previous studies of the authors that customized the new hybrid methodology to manage R&D&I projects in CFAA and validated the project success dimensions and criteria. In the previous researches of authors the hybrid project management methodology for R&D&I projects was developed and the project success dimensions and criteria were defined. This research aimed to answer the following question regarding the R&D&I project success evaluation. When is an appropriate time to assess the project success? Apparently the late assessment of project success is associated with significant drawbacks, therefore, the assessment of project success during the project management life cycle is the purpose of this research. The research methodology is based on the survey regarding the assessment of the project success from the project manager's perspective. The project's success criteria in the survey were translated into qualitative questions ranked through Likert scale and the survey was constructed through reviewing the literature regarding the project success criteria. The validity and reliability of survey were confirmed through smart PLS software to validate the relevancy of questions to measure the contribution of each project success dimensions in the project's success.

After providing an overview of specific challenges that a regulated environment imposes on communications software development, we proceed to examine the 12 agile principles and how they relate to a regulatory environment. From this review we identify two metrics to measure performance of three key regulatory attributes of software for communications applications, and then recommend an approach of either tools, agile methods or DevOps that is best positioned to satisfy its regulated environment attributes.

In order to enhance this topic, we provide a clear view on the implementation of smart city projects from the citizen's perspective. In this paper, we first describe the importance of citizen's participation and different forms of such participation in different smart city project phases. Two case studies are presented as well to demonstrate the benefits of participation in municipal projects. Additionally, we propose a formal solution to this topic. In general, Systems Engineering methodologies are used in order to ensure the right project outcome. There are different methodologies, mostly adopted from the information technology field. Unfortunately, they focus mainly on the relation between a customer (in the case of smart cities it is typically a municipality) and a solution provider. They also do not take into account the new challenges which occur in smart city projects, such as focus on interdisciplinary teams, sharing of resources, or even involvement of citizens. In this paper we enhance this topic by demonstrating how a Hybrid-Agile Methodology (HAM) can used to involve citizens in the different project phases.

Luo",NA,"2008 IEEE Congress on Services Part II (services-2 2008)","8 Dec 2008","2008","","","11","12","Summary form only given. In many decades, many organizations, especially large consulting companies, have been designing, implementing and managing business solutions for every industry around the globe. But due to numerous limitations in process, tooling and skills, most of those solutions were made very specific to individual industry and client needs at its early design stage. Therefore, reuse and more importantly, managing the ever changing business requirements, become almost impossible. Service-orientation and architecture, model-driven business development provides us a new and powerful approach to facilitate asset based industry solution design and development. To further accelerate this, this tutorial discusses about an innovative approach that take advantage of many proven best software engineering practices, from object/component based technology, meta-data driven architecture types (archetypes) that are used to model the common structural and in some cases non-structural business entities such as customer, product, payment, etc. In order to address the consequences introduced by abstracting those common elements out of the specific industry model and be able to enable easy and meta-data based transformation, we properly decompose business components/services into a multi-layered business architecture. Therefore, process/components/services can be decomposed accordingly to facilitate the decomposition and abstraction, while maintaining certain level of necessary traceability across various artifacts. In the realization phase, existing assets/operational systems will be mapped and transformed to the required business components and services to best leverage those existing valuable industry/client investments. To support such a SOA based, model and business driven development process, existing tooling, especially the necessary transformation and integration capability, needs to be significantly enhanced. This tutorial will also present some recommendation based on some recent design and implementation, and they could be used to guide future tooling alignment and integration effort across software modeling, implementation and solution products. In addition, we will present how to leverage existing internal or external assets or product offerings and the open industry reference models and standards (such as ACCORD, ebXML, ARTS/IxRetail). This work is based on authors' collective experience in leading the large end-to-end client engagements across many industries, while promoting various industry leading software engineering best practices.","","978-0-7695-3313-1","10.1109/SERVICES-2.2008.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4700491","","Computer architecture;Software engineering;Computer industry;Companies;Acceleration;Investments;Service oriented architecture;Software tools;Subspace constraints;Best practices","agile manufacturing;flexible manufacturing systems;innovation management;object-oriented programming;product design;product development;software architecture;Web services","business component decomposition;agile industrial solution;flexible industrial solution;business solution management;service-oriented architecture;SOA;model-driven business development;innovative approach;software engineering practice;object-component based technology;meta-data driven architecture;software modeling;open industry reference model;product design;product development;multi layered business architecture","","","12","","","8 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Scrum has become a viable model of ASD focusing on determining immediate deliverables and structuring short timelines, called Sprints, for designing, implementing, and providing them for testing by the customer. While these practices are being adopted by organizations, there is significant difficulty in scaling them to the classroom. Once in place, it is a complex task to evaluate individual student performance based solely on the product outcome and Sprint grade. Thus, there is limited opportunity to catch performance problems that may lead to missing deliverable deadlines or decreasing team trust. In this paper, we impose ASD using Scrum on a senior software projects course in Computer Science. Using a collaborative environment that embeds a social network, project management modules, and event capture system, we perform broad data and event capture and analysis to investigate metrics that are relevant to assessing individual performance aspects related to functioning on an Agile team for software development. Our results suggest that predictive data is available after each Sprint to ascertain individual performance attributes and their relationship to product outcomes.","2377-634X","978-1-4673-5261-1","10.1109/FIE.2013.6685123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6685123","Agile Software Development;performance assessment;Scrum;undergraduate software engineering","Variable speed drives;Measurement;Software engineering;Software;Information services;Electronic publishing;Internet","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;further education;groupware;product development;program testing;project management;social networking (online);software metrics;software prototyping","agile undergraduate software engineering team;individual performance assessment;agile software development process;ASD process;rapid product development;customer requirements;trusted self-organizing development team;Scrum;student performance evaluation;product outcome;Sprint grade;team trust;senior software project course;computer science;collaborative environment;social network;project management modules;event capture system;broad data;event capture;event analysis;individual performance aspects","","10","","23","","19 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Phase 1 was a four month endeavor with a primary focus of collecting data to understand why support was so costly and identify the root cause for each support request. The team strongly believed that this initial phase would be critical to making significant impacts to the quality and supportability of applications. This experience report describes the challenge for the Support 2.0 team and shares the successful adoption of agile practices in redefining the support organization. In the spirit of the agile transition to software development one year prior, our IT organization decided to rethink the approach to application support. By embracing agile principles and utilizing agile concepts, such as a cross functional team, a team collaboration approach with frequent reviews to inspect and adapt as needed, etc, the business was able to reap immediate benefits. It was a challenging journey for the team, where the mix of onshore-offshore support engineers and an integrated client-vendor relationship within an agile team and focused framework helped to transform the support organization from an operational cost center to a value added thought partner. This resulted in a significantly improved culture and effectiveness of the support organization. This unique organization of an agile, cross-functional and team-based approach to handle support requests improved the customer experience, reduced support costs, and ultimately provided greater opportunity for the business to fund new development efforts.","","978-0-7695-3768-9","10.1109/AGILE.2009.23","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5261106","support;culture;organizational change;process change","Costs;Application software;Programming;Collaboration;Data security;Distributed databases;Collaborative work;Communication effectiveness;Delay;Communication system control","organisational aspects;software development management;team working","Support 2.0 project team;organizational support;application quality;application supportability;agile practices adoption;software development;cross functional team;team collaboration;onshore-offshore support engineers;integrated client-vendor relationship","","7","","","","25 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, it is necessary to monitor a project and to track its progress from a management perspective. As a solution, we opt for a monitoring strategy that is based on the project artifacts and corresponding reports. For this, we defined in a previous work a generic artifact model for agile methods to enable seamless communication and data exchange between projects and teams. In this paper, we present a concrete instance aiming at providing the backbone of the information and data exchange subsystem of a SaaS-based collaborative project management and governance software for distributed software development. We present the artifact model, give insights into its development, and discuss its feasibility. Our findings show that while the previously defined reference model adequately reflects basic concepts and thus allows for coupling distributed projects, we need to refine the artifact model to emphasize project management/governance and its implementation in tools.","2329-6313","978-1-4799-4360-9","10.1109/ICGSE.2014.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915248","agile methods;artifact model;governance;distributed projects;project management;experience report","Analytical models;Project management;Software;Data models;Context modeling;Context;Collaboration","cloud computing;project management;software development management;software prototyping","distributed agile project management;project organization;project monitoring strategy;project artifacts;generic artifact model;data exchange;SaaS-based collaborative project management;governance software;software-as-a-service","","6","","13","","2 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Accidental Adoption: The Story of Scrum at Amazon.com","A. Atlas",NA,"2009 Agile Conference","25 Sep 2009","2009","","","135","140","By late 2004, Scrum had been chosen independently as a development process by several teams at Amazon.com. From then until 2009, Scrum spread to a large portion of the software development teams at Amazon. This widespread adoption occurred in part due to the actions of a single individual and in part due to the natural match between Scrumpsilas characteristics and the culture prevalent at Amazon.com. Widespread use of small, independent teams and a general empowerment at the team level made Scrum a smaller step to take for development teams at Amazon than it would be at many companies of equal or greater size. The success of Scrum at Amazon shows how important the prevailing culture of the company can be in terms of supporting an Agile transformation. These lessons are relevant to Scrum transformations being undertaken at many companies today.","","978-0-7695-3768-9","10.1109/AGILE.2009.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5261093","scrum;adoption;culture","Programming;Companies;Delay;Robustness","software development management","accidental adoption;Scrum;software development process;Amazon.com;agile transformation","","10","","5","","25 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We put our whole creativity in what makes it better. As applying the framework, some continual reviews will correct activities. By the use of this framework the risk of the project can be reduced and also the simultaneous cooperation of enterprise architecture and project team is a reliable guarantee for prosperity. Then holding various meetings among stakeholders and presenting the rudimentary models and at last acceptance of them by the stakeholders cause our framework to proceed in a reliable way. Besides all of the stakeholderspsila viewpoints are put in the architecture, so in this way all of their needs are provided. Another point is that several educational classes will be held during its implementation for people involved in, so that the essential statement is taught to them and they can use it wherever necessary. One of the other benefits of this framework is to use a repository in order to keep information, survey, adjust models and use of agile method in all the steps of the framework Finally it is vital to say that this framework is better, faster and cheaper than the classical one.","","978-1-4244-2244-9","10.1109/INFTECH.2008.4621684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621684","","Information technology","business data processing;project management;risk management","agile enterprise architecture;enterprise requirement;project risk;project team","","8","","11","","5 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been observed that the current Agile methods mostly depends on historical data of project for estimation of cost, size, effort and duration and these methods are not efficient in absence of historical data. So there is need of an algorithmic method, which can calculate cost and effort of the project. In our previous work [2] some project-related factors and people-related factors were considered on the basis of which size as well as duration of the project was calculated. However, several other resistance factors may also affects estimation in the Agile dynamic environment. In this work an Algorithmic estimation method is being proposed that calculates more accurate release date, cost, effort and duration for the project by considering various factors. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm has been shown by considering two cases in which different levels of factors are taken and compared.","","978-1-4799-2981-8","10.1109/ICISCON.2014.6965219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965219","Story Point;User-stories;Traditional estimation model;Agile estimation methods;size;cost;effort","Estimation;Software;Resistance;Heuristic algorithms;Complexity theory;Agile software development;Availability","software cost estimation;software prototyping","algorithmic estimation method;cost estimation;resistance factors;agile dynamic environment","","5","","14","","24 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Towards Applying a Safety Analysis and Verification Method Based on STPA to Agile Software Development","Y. Wang; S.

However, due to a lack of safety assurance activities, agile methods are criticized for being inadequate for the development of safe software. Safety analysis and safety verication are complementary methods for safety assurance. Yet, both usually rely on traditional, waterfall-like processes. Therefore, it is strongly needed to integrate an appropriate safety analysis approach into agile software development processes driving architecture design and verify the safe design at the code level. This paper presents a novel agile process model ""S-Scrum"" based on the existing development process ""Safe Scrum""and extended by a safety analysis method and a safety verica- tion approach based on STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis). The proposed agile development process S-Scrum can be separated into three parts: (1) performing safety-guided de- sign by STPA inside each sprint. (2) Verifying safety re- quirements at the code level by using model checking. (3) Replacing traditional RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Main- tainability, Safety) validation on thenal product by STPA safety analysis. We adopt other aspects from the original Safe Scrum. Finally, the feasibility of S-Scrum is illustrated with the example of an airbag system.","","978-1-4503-4157-8","10.1145/2896941.2896948","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809428","Agile methods;STPA;Safety analysis;Safety verication;Safety-critical sytems","Safety;Computer architecture;Software safety;Model checking;Accidents;Agile software development","formal verification;program diagnostics;software maintenance;software prototyping;software reliability","safety verification method;STPA;system-theoretic process analysis;reliability-availability-maintainability-safety;RAMS;model checking;safety requirements;safety-guided design;safety analysis method;Safe Scrum;S-Scrum;agile software development processes driving architecture design","","","","27","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The software development industry has during the last decade aligned around and organized their development adopting agile methodologies. For the researchers, the agile methodologies are a topic for a research, rather than a means of performing the research itself. We can state a question, whether the agile methodologies can be a good common ground for enabling successful research collaboration between industry and academia?

For the current academic year of 2021/2022, changes includes converting traditional lectures into student conference seminars and teachers into mentors, in line with the agile learning approach and values. Focusing on group working skills, communication skills and expected learning outcomes, the students were asked to assess their previous experiences and their own abilities in group work and communication, estimate the required qualities for software engineers, rate their preferences for learning and group work, and describe their overall expectations for the course. For this purpose, a survey was distributed to the 211 students, 117 responded. The results suggests that the students seems to prioritize most of the agile values, with the exception of customer collaboration. It can therefore be concluded that the conditions for introducing an agile learning environment will be fruitful.

This paper proposes a system revision methodology incorporating discrete element simulation and applies it to complex, real world manufacturing systems within an SME. The systems have been successfully modelled through two case studies and results gained to aid decisions to system revision questions. The benefits to the SME in terms of increased system agility and improved performance from the revised systems have been demonstrated.","","978-0-86341-816-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286483","","","agile manufacturing;digital simulation;mass production;small-to-medium enterprises","discrete element simulation;agile manufacturing systems;mass production systems;SMEs","","","","","","8 Aug 2007","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Research has shown that although group estimation in many cases is superior to individual estimation, there is still room for improvement. For instance, group estimation performance can be reduced by dominant personalities and anchoring effects. Through the analysis of 101 user story estimates, made by an XP team for release planning, we investigate whether the introduction of the planning poker estimation process improved the estimation ability of the team. The results show that planning poker improved the team's estimation performance in most cases, but that it increased estimation error in the extreme cases.","","0-7695-2562-8","10.1109/AGILE.2006.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667560","","Process planning;Contracts;Software performance;Delay estimation;Estimation error;Computer industry;Resource management;Programming;Software testing;Strategic planning","project management;software development management;planning;software process improvement","user story estimation;group estimation;Extreme Programming;planning poker estimation","","47","","9","","14 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"An Approach to Support the Specification of Agile Artifacts in the Development of Safety-Critical Systems","A. I. M. Leite","Tech. Univ.

In the case of safety-critical systems, this challenge is even greater, since misinterpretations can lead to catastrophic damages to humans and to the environment. Agile development proposes minimizing the challenges in requirements specifications through short iterations, quick feedback, and active stakeholders. However, in safety-critical systems development, there is a gap (either geographical, cultural, educational, or temporal) between safety engineers and developers. [Question Problem] Therefore, it is not possible to be assured by agile development teams that safety aspects are well understood by developers, and, if the latter are aware of the criticality of the problem, that they can implement them accordingly. [Principal Ideas Results] The proposed research aims to provide adequate support for more accurate specification of agile development artifacts in the development of safety-critical systems. In this regard, the first contribution of this research aims at defining an Agile Safety Process, whose purpose is to identify which artifacts or parts thereof are enough to specify failure detection and containment, as well as measures for taking the system to a safe state. The second contribution aims at providing a semi-automated methodology for supporting the specification of agile artifacts, taking into account safety aspects. As a consequence, this research will have a significant impact in terms of improving the creation of evidences to be submitted for certification in terms of timing and accuracy.","2332-6441","978-1-5386-3191-1","10.1109/RE.2017.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049178","Safety Requirements;User Stories;Agile Development;Safety-Critical Systems","Safety;Stakeholders;Software;Software engineering;Certification;Maintenance engineering","formal specification;safety;safety-critical software;software prototyping","safety-critical systems development;safety engineers;agile development artifacts;Agile Safety Process;agile artifacts;safety aspects;requirements specification;agile development teams;software engineering","","2","","28","","25 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we investigate alignment between two different documentation practices and agile development. We report upon an experiment conducted to explore the impact of formalism and media type on various dimensions of documentation practice in agile teams. 28 students in 8 teams were divided into two groups: SAD and UML. Group SAD was to update and deliver their high-level software architecture in form of a textual description defined by RUP templates. Group UML was instructed to update and deliver their low-level software design in form of UML models. Our results show that iterative documentation practices led to more extensive and more detailed textual documentation. We found that writing documentation was perceived as a intrusive task leading to task specialization and allocation of documentation to less qualified team members. Consequently, this hampered collaboration within the team. Based in our findings, we suggest that if documentation is to be delivered with the project, producing documentation should be communicated and accepted by the team as a proper product. Furthermore, we argue that codification of internal development knowledge should be a non-intrusive task.","","978-1-4673-2622-3","10.1109/Agile.2012.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298089","agile teams;software development;knowledge sharing;project management;organizational management and coordination;process improvement","Documentation;Unified modeling language;Encoding;Teamwork;Software architecture;Software design","software architecture;software prototyping;sustainable development;system documentation;Unified Modeling Language","documentation work;agile teams;documentation formalism role;sustainable practice;agile software development;iterative documentation practices;SAD group;UML group;high-level software architecture;textual description;RUP templates;low-level software design;textual documentation;task specialization;documentation allocation","","15","","28","","13 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast to traditional methods, agile methods place more emphasis on flexible processes than on detailed upfront plans and heavy documentation. Since agile methods have proved to be successful at the team level, large organizations are now aiming to scale agile methods to the enterprise level by adopting and applying so-called scaling agile frameworks such as Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) or Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). Although there is a growing body of literature on large-scale agile development, literature documenting actual experiences related to scaling agile frameworks is still scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a case study on the adoption and application of LeSS in four different products of a German automobile manufacturer. Based on seven interviews, we present how the organization adopted and applied LeSS, and discuss related challenges and success factors. The comparison of the products indicates that transparency, training courses and workshops, and change management are crucial for a successful adoption.","","978-1-5386-9196-0","10.1109/ICGSE.2019.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807470","large-scale agile development;scaling agile frameworks;large-scale scrum;case study","Software;Companies;Automobiles;Interviews;Training;Standards organizations","automobile industry;automobile manufacture;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;team working","scaling agile frameworks;German automobile manufacturer;agile methods;software development processes;heavy documentation;large-scale agile development;Scaled Agile Framework;large-scale scrum","","2","","21","","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this light, the article's goal is to report the case study's experience for the implementation of an Agile Risk Management Process in multiple projects environments, called GARA (Gestatildeo aacutegil de Riscos de Ambiente). Some projects were selected to participate in the process which aims to perform an active management of existing impediments mainly those affect more than one project because of its importance or being share resources among these projects. Benefits like the communication among Project Leaders and their experiences in solving impediments are also discussed.","2159-5119","978-1-890843-20-5","10.1109/PICMET.2009.5262002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5262002","","Risk management;Project management;Impedance;Software engineering;Programming;Uncertainty;Software development management;Engineering management;Writing;Resource management","project management;risk management;software engineering","agile risk management process;multiple projects environments;project risk management;organizational environment;software engineering;software development","","","","16","","25 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, project management has rapidly evolved into a more structured and sophisticated methodology which is vital not only to meet the growing stakeholder expectations and technology improvements but also a mandatory requirement for the software development companies to achieve competitive advantage and maintain business survival. Software project management approaches have evolved from traditional to agile to global with a shift in their inherent characteristics at different levels of operations and this shift poses a challenge for companies in choosing the appropriate approach based on their project needs. Current literature lacks attention in understanding the evolutionary characteristics of the varying project management approaches at the different operational levels. This study investigates the project management approaches at the individual, project, team and company levels to examine how these approaches vary in terms of characteristics in traditional, agile, and global software development contexts. Improved understanding of the evolution of project management approaches and their underlying characteristics will enable project management professionals and software developers to make appropriate decisions to achieve project success.","","978-1-6654-9552-3","10.1109/CSDE53843.2021.9718471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9718471","Project management;software project management;IT project management;evolution of project management;multilevel project management;levels of project management","Computer science;Conferences;Project management;Companies;Data engineering;Software;Stakeholders","evolutionary computation;organisational aspects;project management;software development management","evolutionary characteristics;software development companies;project management approaches;operational levels;company levels;traditional software development contexts;agile software development contexts;global software development contexts;project management professionals;software developers","","","","47","IEEE","1 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This often resulted in delays, budget overruns and disappointing deliverables. During the last decade, the Agile approach has been taking over software project management, shortening product development cycles from a few years to a few weeks or even days. Recently, the agile approach has even been used for developing a new car which runs 100 miles per gallon [1]. Several recent surveys [2], [3] show that agile methodologies like Scrum, Extreme Programming or Kanban have successfully been adopted by many companies to develop software. However, agile methodologies do not come for free. A different set of skills, or agile practices as they are called, are necessary for the software engineers in order to be able to sucessfully deliver high-quality software at the end of every iteration. The same surveys show that only few of the agile practices are used and even fewer are applied consequently and thoroughly. This is to a great extent due to the lack of skilled software engineers. Although teaching agile software development has drawn some attention in recent research, we do not yet seem to be able to “deliver” the appropriately skilled engineers. What is the reason for this, and more importantly, how can we improve the situation? In this position paper we propose a more holistic approach for teaching agile software engineering, in which the required agile practices and values are not only integrated theoretically but also practically applied and repeated until they become a habit to students and software engineers.","2165-9567","978-1-4799-3191-0","10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826229","Software Engeering;Openness;Agile Processes;Education","Software;Education;Software engineering;Companies;Conferences;Programming profession","computer science education;DP industry;kanban;product development;project management;software management;software prototyping;software quality;teaching","sustainable teaching approach;software engineering education;software engineering teaching;software industry;agile approach;software project management;product development cycle;agile methodology;Scrum;extreme programming;Kanban;high-quality software;agile software development;agile software engineering","","8","","14","","5 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As part of our continuous process improvement effort, the Agile methodology is being introduced as an alternative approach to software development. To meet the needs of sponsor requirements and satisfy our quality management processes a tailoring of Agile is required. Development of ground software tools is currently in progress at JHU/APL to support NASA's Solar Probe Plus (SPP) Mission Operations. Tool development for spacecraft operation planning activities is paving the way for the cultural shift to agile methodology on candidate projects. The user community, the SPP Mission Operations team located at JHU/APL, supports the Agile Manifesto of heavy user involvement, the need for flexibility to evolve requirements and deliver frequent software releases to support readiness activities for the SPP launch in the summer of 2018. Agile was implemented following Scrum on two SPP GSW products, a spacecraft software simulator and the spacecraft activity planning tool. The paper will briefly introduce the heritage development process and compare this process with the evolving Agile approach. The discussion will include an assessment of how Agile methodology is being tailored using Scrum to adhere to our quality management processes (e.g., peer reviews, software assurance) to meet sponsor compliance requirements for current and future JHU/APL spacecraft missions.

However, software development teams do not consider situational needs that delay software delivery, resulting in the late discovery of incompatible assumptions and architecture level rework. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the situational factors that need to be considered by software development teams before developing a software product. We further present taxonomical classification and comprehensively map the situational factors that impact design development and advancement in the proposed Situational Agile Distributed Development (SADD) model. We propose 18 directed hypotheses against each situational factor that supports our SADD model. In order to evaluate our directed hypotheses, statistical analysis method is used, and the level of confidence of each directed hypothesis is validated. The result of our study confirms that global software development teams are highly reliant on the SADD Model. Our study will largely contribute by devising a multilevel taxonomy of situational factors that elevate the performance of global software development teams.

Researchers analyzed quality attribute concerns from 15 years of Architecture Trade-Off Analysis Method data, gathered from 31 projects. Modifiability was the dominant concern across all project types; performance, availability, and interoperability also received considerable attention. For IT projects, a relatively new quality-deployability-emerged as a key concern. The study results provide insights for agile teams allocating architecture-related tasks to iterations. For example, teams can use these results to create checklists for release planning or retrospectives to help assess whether to address a given quality to support future needs.

Choosing and adaptation of any methodology depends on the type and people involved in the project. Employee behavior, their mutual relations and enthusiasm is one of factors which can critically affect success of the method implementation. So, these factors also measured all through the version of agile methodology. There is no doubt that the foundation of agile techniques is people. The motive of this paper is to introduce a best method for implementation of the agile methodology.

Despite the implementation of `agile methods' to enable shorter development cycles and continuous customer feedback, the success score of most corporates still lacks market-changing innovations. Disruption is a continuous process that should start with niche products focusing on insufficiently addressed customer needs and - given a positive market feedback - continue with new variants to gain market share step-by-step. Hence, a needs-oriented definition of the initial product offer followed by a need-based planning of future product variants are essential for a disruptive product strategy. Yet, companies' failure rates of ~40% for new products show that the need-based definition of minimum viable products and the planning of later product generations is insufficient. In this paper, the authors present a framework for a disruption-oriented product planning process. Based on a literature analysis focused on methodologies supporting the development process of potentially disruptive innovations, basic criteria are derived and deficits of existing approaches are identified. The framework will help companies as a guideline to understand the overall process of how to develop disruptive innovations. It further explains the essential activities and their interactions.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-37-3","10.23919/PICMET.2018.8481927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8481927","","Planning;Companies;Technological innovation;Focusing;Industries","agile manufacturing;customer satisfaction;customer services;innovation management;product development;production planning;strategic planning","market-changing innovations;continuous process;disruptive product strategy;product generations;disruption-oriented product planning process;customer feedback;failure rates;agile methods;product development","","","","78","","7 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this paper is to identify the important dynamic characteristics of Big Data projects, and explore how a modeling and simulation technique called system dynamics (SD) can be applied these characteristics. The approach draws from applicable concepts in the domains of traditional project management, Agile software development and Lean product development, and proposes to develop a model called Big Data Project Dynamics (BDPD) incorporating these insights. The BDPD model is organized into sectors: Core Rework Cycle, Iterative & Incremental, Exploration & Learning, Economic Value, and Policy Actions & Consequences. Given ADPD, practitioners can simulate Big Data project behavior from initial conditions, and probabilistically predict project outcomes.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258186","Big Data Project;System Dynamics;Prediction;Modeling & Simulation;Project Management","Big Data;Data models;Project management;Organizations;Tools;Predictive models;Complexity theory","Big Data;DP industry;DP management;product development;project management","outcome prediction;system dynamics;project management;agile software development;lean product development;BDPD;SD;Big Data project behavior;Big Data Project Dynamics;big data projects","","5","","27","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This issue could be addressed by offering traceability mechanism that helps to trace the effect of functional requirement changes on the non-functional requirements. Unfortunately, there are a few researchers that provide study regarding this issue.

"Testing Processes in Business-Critical Chain Software Lifecycle","G. R.

The traditional software development projects work on the assumption that all `equal effort consumers' would be treated equally and worked upon. The agile methodology ensures that the delivery cycles are reduced thus introducing agility in the way business is supported by underlying technologies. The proposed lifecycle model introduces new variables pertaining to the business value generation each finished piece of code would produce. Hence the software project processes have to be modified to cater to it. Even the usual agile lifecycle testing strategies need to be modified to suit the proposed model. The test plans, test estimations, test resource management, quality control, regression plans and automation road map and plans have to be customized to cater to the new life cycle model. The secondary project management activities such as risk management, procurement management, etc also may to be modified with respect to the testing processes. My paper aims at using the critical chain principles and proposes a software lifecycle model that can cater to business priorities and aligning the testing processes not only to development cycles but also to the actual business value created. In this paper I would take a case study and compare and contrast when project uses the regular models and this new model. I would also provide guidelines to use this lifecycle model and modify regular project management activities to cater to the new model with emphasis on the testing processes. The paper would try to provide the ideal scenarios; in project teams, in consulting firms and in new customers and expectations; where such a model could provide high impact on the way consulting companies can do successful projects and creating more value to the customers.","","978-0-7695-3570-8","10.1109/WCSE.2009.424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319542","","Life testing;Software testing;Automatic testing;Project management;Programming;Risk management;Life estimation;Resource management;Quality control;Automation","business data processing;life testing;program testing;project management;software quality","testing processes;business-critical chain software lifecycle;agile software development lifecycle;business priorities;software development projects;business value generation;software project processes;agile lifecycle testing strategies;test plans;test estimations;test resource management;quality control;regression plans;automation road map;secondary project management","","","","1","","10 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are also proposing a systematic way for identifying business problems as part of the framework. The process is Agile, so it would start from investigating the data set dimensions to identify business problems. It also allows early Business people cooperation with data scientist. We've applied the proposed framework in one of the Middle East government organizations.

Story-point estimation enables software development teams to, among other things, better scope products, prioritize requirements, allocate resources and measure progress. Several machine learning techniques have been proposed for automated story-point estimation. However, most of these techniques use open-source projects for evaluation. There are important differences between open-source and commercial projects with respect to story authoring. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a state-of-the-art machine learning technique, known as Deep-SE [3], for estimating story points in a commercial project. Our dataset is comprised of 4,727 stories for a data anonymization product developed by a 27-member agile team at a healthcare data science company, IQVIA. Over this dataset, Deep-SE achieved a mean absolute error of 1.46, significantly better than three different baselines. Model performance nonetheless varied across stories, with the estimation error being larger for stories that had higher points. Our results further indicate that model performance is correlated with certain story characteristics such as the level of detail and the frequency of vague terms in the stories. An important take-away from our study is that, before organizations attempt to introduce machine learning-based estimation into agile development, they need to better embrace agile best practices, particularly in relation to story authoring and expert-based estimation.","","978-1-6654-1898-0","10.1109/REW53955.2021.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582288","Agile Development;Story-point Estimation;Machine Learning","Systematics;Conferences;Semantics;Estimation;Machine learning;Predictive models;Software measurement","learning (artificial intelligence);product development;software development management;software prototyping","agile development;agile software engineering;software development teams;automated story-point estimation;open-source projects;commercial projects;story authoring;estimation error;story characteristics;machine learning-based estimation;expert-based estimation;healthcare data science company;Deep-SE;IQVIA","","","","23","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Widespread use of agile has changed the way we must think about practices both in Requirements Engineering (RE) and in System Testing (ST). Our experience shows that many challenges in the application of large-scale agile development relate to either RE or ST, and in particular to the alignment between these areas. In this paper we present large-scale agile-related challenges from a multiple case study which relate to REST alignment. We map our challenges to an existing framework for REST alignment, and make an initial attempt to suggest agile RE practices from the literature which may alleviate these challenges. Our results show that the interviewed companies need to first adopt more agile RE practices to enhance REST alignment and then leverage agile testing.

From these interviews, we have identified seven themes which are characteristic indicators of peer motivation. We interrogate observational data from five mature XP teams to consider whether and how these characteristic indicators are present in an XP environment. We find that XP teams in our study had processes in place that supported many of the motivational needs voiced by developers coming from a traditional, heavyweight software development environment.

While a number of research papers have consistently proposed the adoption of Agile practices, it is not clear how a software development process would help to solve the issues present in the mobile domain. Moreover, there is a lack of evidence that shows a clear link between the proposed methodologies and their utilization in a real-world setting. Finally, the rapid evolution of the mobile environment challenges several of the premises upon which the proposed methodologies were created.

The findings show that scrum roles and practices did not conflict with enterprise policies or processes and were thought to improve product quality and productivity. However, agile practices from the XP tradition were not so widely adopted. Test driven development did not integrate well within enterprises where independent quality assurance teams were constituted as separate departments. Continuous integration was found to be challenging where enterprise software products required time consuming regression testing and elaborate code release processes.

Experienced project managers usually provide more accurate estimate of these quantities. The traditional project management methodologies, such as System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), were developed to handle software and information engineering projects of longer duration and larger number of project members. Many projects in modern days have short duration and smaller number of project members. They tend to follow newer methodologies, such as Agile Development, to adapt to the faster changes of modern technologies and user requirements. For a project manager, gathering information to properly create an effective project plan is like identifying a collection of problems and solving them. Solving problems needs supporting resources, which is analogous to the fact that projects need adequate supporting resources. Chang [1] proposed three elements of methods of problem solving with supporting resource capabilities. This paper proposes an approach that uses these resource capabilities to estimate and manage contingency reserves of a modern-day project in software or information engineering.","2154-0373","978-1-4673-0818-2","10.1109/EIT.2012.6220715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6220715","project management;contingency;methods of problem solving;reserve;resource capability;software engineering;information engineering","Software;Schedules;Project management;Problem-solving;Educational institutions;Semantics","project management;risk management;software development management;software prototyping","resource capability;contingency reserve planning;contingency reserve management;software engineering project;information engineering project;project management;risk reduction;system development life cycle;software handling;agile development","","1","","14","","21 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, a number of studies have suggested that pair programming improves software quality. The literature speculates that the 'driver' (the programmer currently typing in the code) and 'navigator' work together in a complimentary manner, and that the nature of these roles may be key in realizing the reported benefits. Here we dispute two of these existing claims: (i) that the navigator providing a 'continual review' of the driver's work and highlighting errors (i.e. acting as a reviewer); (ii) that the navigator is focused on a higher level of abstraction that the driver (i.e. acting as a foreman). Our findings suggest that the key to the success of pair programming does not lie in the differences in behaviour or focus between the driver and navigator. Rather, we suggest an alternative perspective (the ""tag team "") and remark upon the proliferation of talk at an intermediate level of detail in pair programmers' conversations. This leads us to suggest that producing the type of talk necessary to work effectively together may itself be fundamental in realizing the reported improvements in software quality.","","0-7695-2872-4","10.1109/AGILE.2007.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293578","","Navigation;Programming profession;Software quality;Collaborative work;Laboratories;Collaborative software;Production;Keyboards;Mice;Error analysis","programming;software quality","intermediate-level conversation;pair programming;software quality","","10","","24","","27 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New sales technology (e-commerce) had to meet and match (A) the complex, sometimes unpredictable customer expectations and behaviors (sales conversion) and (B) the product development of new products in a very dynamic, transparent and competitive market successfully because fast adapting creative companies grew often with such a speed that the structure required to manage the processes and projects could not grow at the same pace. In some instances, the market demand even forced such companies to act internationally immediately and globally later which added a new layer of complexity. After recognizing those parallel fields of complexity, the ""Best in Class"" companies initiated strategic projects and project management to manage this complexity pattern to finally increase the business success. The paper will use a real world example (E-Commerce High Tech Bicycle Company entering the US market) where this complexity exists (agile product development, fast growing business, new dynamic market, multi-cultural stakeholders) to illustrate the complexity layers and to describe which approaches and methods from other industries (e.g. Automotive) and business fields (Complex Project Management) were used to increase the enterprise expertise in different dimensions (organization, product, humans, program management). The paper will bring specific focus to the practical aspects, e.g. how to respond if the complexity creates dysfunctional moments. Finally, this paper will describe why and how theoretical models of complex project management, agility and decision making (Values, Eclectic, Psychology, Sociology and Power Based Factors.) were combined to identify needed actions, changes - and thus facilitated success.","","978-1-5386-1639-0","10.1109/STC-CSIT.2017.8099445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8099445","Project Management;Portfolio Management;E-Commerce;Complexity;Bicycle","Complexity theory;Decision making;Companies;Project management;Stakeholders","bicycles;electronic commerce;Internet;knowledge management;management of change;organisational aspects;product development;production engineering computing;project management;sales management;strategic planning","Class companies;strategic projects;complexity pattern;US market;dynamic market;complex project management;structured PM approach;agile product portfolio;sales conversion;customer behaviors;customer expectations;e-commerce high tech bicycle company","","","","39","","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal is to identify inaccurate effort estimates to enable more precise project scheduling and release planning. In a first step, basic terms (e.g. development effort, functional effort) of traditional effort estimation were declared in the agile context. Afterwards-within the main part of the paper-a set of metrics is proposed, which can be used to evaluate accuracy of estimates. These metrics are based on the estimated efforts and interim results of the estimation process. Since the usage of these metrics needs to be seamlessly integrated into the Planning Poker process, we have conceptualized a computer-aided tool to collect and evaluate necessary data. To get a first proof of concept and preliminary feedback, we developed a corresponding prototype and applied it to a students' project. The prototype is based on a stationary multi-touch device and offers an intuitive user interface to perform the Planning Poker process. While estimation takes place, it collects required data and identifies inaccurate estimates with the help of the proposed metrics.

In this paper, we have suggested an approach that guides software projects managers in assignment of integrated users in development process. The basic definition of this process is based on a set of layers represented by nested circles. Circles from the center to the external surface represent, respectively, initial or starting userspsila requirements, software architecture, design level and codification level. These layers are decomposed into slices from the center to the external circle. Each slice represents a different view that corresponds to a specific class of users. In our process, developers have not constrained by a specific views approach, they can choose the appropriate views approach from the literature (e.g. 4+1 view approach). Initial requirements, in this process, are represented by an extension of use case diagram definition of UML. The proposed process is driven by requirements. It is used for large software systems developed by a numerous and heterogeneous development teams. The developed process is characterized by its simplicity, and it can be easily adapted for other agile processes.","","978-0-7695-3674-3","10.1109/DepCoS-RELCOMEX.2009.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5261031","Agile Development;User's views;Use case;Communication paradigm","Laboratories;Computer science;Project management;Software systems;Software architecture;Software design;Unified modeling language;Software development management;Programming;Frequency","project management;software architecture;software management;Unified Modeling Language;user interfaces","development process;agile methods;user organization;user interaction;software projects management;user requirements;software architecture;design level;codification level;UML;software systems","","2","","16","","25 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A survey instrument for measuring the preference for agile methods was developed and validated. The results from the quantitative data collected from the survey study indicate that three out of the five personality factors from the Five Factor Model show a correlation with above average preference for agile methods. These factors are extra version, openness and neuroticism. The first two have a positive relationship with agile preference while neuroticism (emotional instability) has a negative relationship with agile methodology preference.

Based on this finding and the demand for secure software, we propose a security enhanced Scrum model (Trustworthy Scrum) by taking advantages of both security activities and Scrum framework which has fast adaptation and iterative cycle.

In a markerless environment this is often done with SLAM algorithms which, for localization, pick out features in the environment and compare how they have changed from keyframe to current frame. However, human head agility, such as seen in video gaming tasks or training exercises, poses a problem; fast rotations will cause all previously tracked features to no longer be within the field of view and the system will struggle to localize accurately. In this paper we present an approach that is capable of tracking a human head's agile movements by using an array of RGB-D sensors and a reconstruction of this sensor data into 360 degrees of features that is fed into our SLAM algorithm. We run an experiment with pre-recorded agile movement scenarios that demonstrate the accuracy of our system. We also compare our approach against single sensor algorithms and show a significant improvement (up to 15 to 20 times better accuracy) in localization. The development of our sensor array and SLAM algorithm creates a novel approach to accurately localize extremely agile human head movements.","","978-1-5386-7592-2","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2018.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8699274","Human-centered computing—Human Computer Interaction—Interaction Paradigms—Mixed / Augmented Reality;Computing Methodologies—Artificial Intelligence—Computer Vision—Tracking","Sensor arrays;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Tracking;Head;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Cameras","augmented reality;computer games;image colour analysis;image motion analysis;SLAM (robots);solid modelling","sensor data;RGB-D sensors;tracked features;fast rotations;video gaming tasks;human head agility;current frame;markerless environment;realistic augmented reality systems;agile head movements;AgileSLAM;extremely agile human head movements;sensor array;single sensor algorithms;pre-recorded agile movement scenarios;SLAM algorithm","","1","","34","","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A discrete event simulation model was developed to represent a moderately sized, low yield production facility to evaluate different production factors, such as arrival times, number of entities, resource availabilities, and work in process times, compared to the total yield at the production facility. A comparative analysis with cost was performed to determine the effect that varied resources had on the total output to determine the optimal solution to increasing and/or maintaining the production yields of those prior to the changes to the production process. The goal of approaching production based on related factors was to demonstrate the effect that redesigning a product and the related production process has on the production outputs. The results helped to successfully develop a model that is able to provide analytical data to a business case proposal for optimizing production resource allocations.

While the community seems split into two camps of for and against, the majority of extreme programmers favour to define the system using only the traditional customer focused user stories. In some cases the technical story arguments are academic, but our experience report demonstrates clearly why sticking to user stories has its benefits. Our experience using Scrum and XP has been that allowing technical stories into the process can de-rail the ability to deliver constant, measurable business value per iteration, as well as inhibit the planning process. Once technical stories are allowed, the customer and business can be alienated very quickly, especially when they have no engineering background. Furthermore, when problems occur and the technical stories begin to slip, the customer can be left in a very difficult position, not knowing how to re- prioritise or direct the process. It is therefore our intention to highlight some of the pitfalls that can result from using technical stories.","","0-7695-2872-4","10.1109/AGILE.2007.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293619","","Programming profession;Process planning;Project management;Team working;Fires","programming;software engineering","extreme programming;agile development;customer focused user stories;technical story;Scrum","","","","3","","27 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While efforts have been made to map different types of analytics to an agile methodology, the steps are often described as breaking activities into smaller tasks while the overall process is still consistent with step-by-step waterfall. BDA changes a number of the activities in the analytics lifecycle, as well as their ordering.

The research applies a system dynamics model for simulating the influence of these parameters on project performance, particularly relating schedule and scope dimensions. In this article, we compare the impact of different relations between product complexity and team seniority on three projects in order to test the method. Only the product primary functions must be taken into account for gathering data from product complexity, and team seniority must be known. Besides, the decision-maker applies a first-order linear model to a goal-seeking background to predict the project schedule for a specified product scope.

Cost and effort are important factors whenever a project is developed. The estimation of cost and effort is a difficult task in Agile environment. It has been observed that the current Agile methods mostly depends on an expert opinion, planning poker and historical data of project for estimation of cost, size, effort and duration. In absence of the historical data and experts the previous methods are not efficient. So there is need of an algorithmic method, which can calculate cost and effort of the project. In this direction S.Bhalero, Maya Ingel [2] has considered some project-related factors that calculate the size as well as duration of the project. However, several other project as well as people related factors may affect the Agile environment. In this work an Algorithmic estimation method is being proposed considering various factors thereby estimating the more accurate release date, cost, effort and duration for the project. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm has been shown by considering three cases in which different levels of factors are taken and compared.","","978-93-80544-12-0","10.1109/IndiaCom.2014.6828023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6828023","Agile Estimation Model;cost;effort;size;user-stories","Estimation;Software;Complexity theory;Security;Hardware;Computers;Software algorithms","project management;scheduling;software cost estimation;software development management","agile estimation;project related factors;project completion;project scheduling;project development;agile method;expert opinion;planning;project historical data;algorithmic method;project cost estimation;project effort estimation;project size;project duration;algorithmic estimation method;release date","","18","","12","","12 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Non-functional requirements testing is challenging due its cross-functional aspects and lack of clarity of their needs by business in the most part of projects. The goal of this paper is to empirically investigate how do agile team members handle non-functional testing in their projects, aiming to identify preliminary factors influencing the testing of non-functional requirements, specifically performance and security in agile development.

However, there is a lack of practical guidance on how to manage changes in agile requirements engineering. Although we need to consider all areas of requirements engineering, the author has seen three key themes: (1) How to focus on customer value and represent it clearly for smooth communication between teams in a large enterprise?

Currently, lean approaches are increasingly adopted for complementing agile methods in software processes. With the goal of providing up-to-day results that can be used by organizations implementing or planning to implement agile and/or lean methods, we have conducted a study on the current stage of agile and lean adoption and usage in the software industry. For this purpose, we conducted an extensive survey among Finnish software practitioners in 2011, using the membership registry of The Finnish Information Processing Association (FIPA)as a sampling frame. 408 responses were collected from 200 software intensive organizations in the study. The survey included questions for identifying the rate of agile and lean usage in software organizations as well as the implementation of specific methods and practices, goals in adopting agile and lean, reasons for not applying these methods and effects of the agile and lean usage. The results of the survey reveal that a majority of respondents' organizational units are using agile and/or lean methods (58%).

The reasons and benefits for using agile and lean methods appeared to correspond in most parts to the findings of the earlier research. Generally, the experiences of using agile and lean methods seem to be rather positive, although challenges, such as obtaining management support and limitations for scaling agile in distributed settings, were also identified.","1949-3789","978-1-4503-1056-7","10.1145/2372251.2372275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475408","Agile;lean;survey","Software;Variable speed drives;Industries;Companies;Programming;Standards organizations","lean production;software houses;software process improvement;software prototyping","lean usage;agile usage;Finnish software industry;agile methods;lean approaches;software process;Finnish software practitioners;The Finnish Information Processing Association;FIPA;sampling frame;software intensive organizations;software organizations","","33","","33","","7 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We know that there are certain issues at both ends like-novice client, lack of strong visualization power of business analyst at vendor side, lack of skilled resources, fluctuating/invalid requirements, etc. When we try to find its root-cause, we found `Agility', which fits to high rising and fast pace even in changing of needs and technology under development. In any IT industry, it is not that easy stuff to keep up with solution delivery and meet ever-changing requirements of client without a proper plan. `Kanban' can easily work here, which requires strong team building. On top of it when inter departmental or cross track teams involved, it becomes little dicey to monitor delivery also it leads to dependency. Therefore, at the level of `Program Management' we need a more sophisticated model to deal with those challenges. Right now there is no any such model exists which will be useful on the program management level.

They are important and critical to the success of any software in the market as they considered as the differentiating factor from other software products that provide similar functionality. Agile methodology became popular during the last few years, and although it improves the process of software development, it has a number of limitations regarding requirements analysis. Neglecting the non-functional requirements is one of the biggest limitations in Agile. It doesn't provide any widely accepted technique for elicitation and management of non-functional requirements. This paper summarizes two existing approaches that are currently used to analysis NFRs, and then it provides an enhanced approach for better analysis of NFRs. The new approach is better than the existing ones, because it combines their strengths and overcome their weaknesses.","","978-1-4673-7869-7","10.1109/ICCNEEE.2015.7381407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381407","Requirements Engineering;non-functional requirements;Functional requirement;Internal quality attributes;External quality attributes;Agile Methodology","Software;Requirements engineering;Requirements management;Stakeholders;Process control;Computer science","software product lines;software prototyping","nonfunctional requirements analysis;agile environment;NFR;quality attributes;software products;agile methodology;software development","","5","","14","","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The answer could be in affirmative. And towards this larger end of delivering high quality software and ensuring customer satisfaction, promulgated explicitly or imbibed implicitly, there has been sustained efforts towards creating and adopting new ways, new models and methods of software development. As we know, in 2001, some stalwarts and experts in various software development methods congregated in Snowbird, Utah to sign what is known as the `agile manifesto'. Much water has flown since then across the Ganges and the Thames. The present paper is a theoretical reflection on the agile development paradigm and in the process the paper tries to propose a theoretical foundation to this fertile field, taking a system's perspective; including the system-of-systems understanding. The theoretical foundation that we present in the paper is built on the ideas relating to change as in Goldratt's Thinking Processes of the theory of constraints. For theoretical evidence, the paper discusses agile development principles and practices and then maps the agile principles to the elements of the thinking processes. We argue that since agile development is all about customer centricity, customer proximity with respect to his needs and change requirements, feedback and change in general; the theoretical underpinnings for agile development stay hidden in the body of knowledge relating to `cybernetics of cybernetics' and the thinking processes of the theory of constraints. However, in the present paper, the focus remains to find the theoretical foundation to agile development through the change challenges and dynamics as expounded by Kotter and the thinking processes; as explained in the paper.","","978-1-4799-1920-8","10.1109/SysEng.2015.7302798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7302798","agile;thinking processes;cybernetics of cybernetics;second order science;change;theoretical foundation","Software;Context;Complexity theory;Organizations;Uncertainty;Cybernetics","software prototyping;software quality","software development;high quality software;customer satisfaction;agile manifesto;system-of-systems understanding;Goldratt thinking processes;constraints theory;agile development principles;agile development practices;customer centricity;customer proximity;change requirements;cybernetics-of-cybernetics","","1","","42","","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Entire industries, where regulations and government standards play an important role (e.g. health care, avionics, etc.), have used long development cycles that relied on detailed up-front planning before advancing to any detailed decision. In contrast to this mindset, agile software development has proven to deliver results that satisfy customers needs faster than traditional waterfall methodologies. The lack of detailed upfront planning and fast delivery cycles have led to situations where the use of agile became synonymous with lack of documentation and poor quality, and hence the perception that the approach is not suitable for regulated systems. In this experience paper we describe the implementation of a service that integrates medical device software compliance specific activities such as architectural design and limited risk management into the daily agile practices of a software development team.","","978-1-7281-7415-0","10.1109/ICSA-C50368.2020.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9095608","","Software;Documentation;Standards;Unified modeling language;Tools;Planning;Agile software development","medical computing;risk management;software architecture;software development management;software prototyping","long development cycles;agile software development;customer satisfaction;upfront planning;fast delivery cycles;medical device software compliance specific activities;software development team;CompliancePal;regulatory-compliant development;digital transformation;software trigger;ripple effect;government standards","","4","","15","","19 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile maturity assessment models have been helpful in providing means and guidance for reducing this gap. Yet, a detailed look into existing models, comparative studies and literature reviews in the domain suggests that the agile maturity assessment models themselves are far from being mature. Further, the gap between what the proposed models offer and what industry really needs is frequently discussed by those comparative studies. In this study, we reflect on the existing agile maturity assessment models, compare them against a comprehensive set of criteria derived from the literature and from our background in assessing the capabilities of software development organizations.

Literature shows high rates of failure, for numerous reasons, when it comes to innovation projects, among which are the project management approach and the inability to tackle the complexity and uncertainty connected to the project. This paper will discuss the concept of innovation projects and the challenges they face then propose means to address those challenges by proposing an adaptive project management approach based on agile-thinking. This approach is then extended to include the concept of minimum viable product delivery, known from the fields of product development, engineering and start-ups. The combination of the two concepts, with reflection on the peculiarities of innovation projects, offer a novel approach to work in adaptive life-cycles, while focusing on creating an incremental, deployable product. To test its validity, this approach is then applied on a case study from an innovation project with the aim to create a cargo vessel in a competition setting.","","978-1-5386-0697-1","10.1109/IDAACS.2017.8095121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8095121","Innovation projects;Minimum viable product (MVP) Adaptive project management;Agile life-cycles;Ecochallenge","Project management;Technological innovation;Complexity theory;Uncertainty;Planning;Adaptive systems","innovation management;product development;project management","miniumum viable product creation;product development;adaptive life-cycles;cargo vessel;adaptive project management approach;Innovation Project Management","","1","","37","","7 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper also reports on a pilot study of teams using the framework. The framework adheres to the lean Kanban philosophy but augments Kanban by providing a structured iteration process for teams to incrementally explore and learn via lean hypothesis testing. Specifically, the Structured Kanban Iteration (SKI) framework focuses on having teams define capability-based iterations (as opposed to Kanban-like no iterations or Scrumlike time-based sprints). Furthermore, unlike Kanban, the framework leverages Scrum best practices to define roles, meetings and artifacts. Thus, SKI implements the Kanban process, but with a more repeatable and structured approach.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005591","Data Science;Big Data;Agile;Process Methodology","Data science;Big Data;Task analysis;Project management;Data mining;Data models","data handling;iterative methods;kanban;project management","agile framework;data science project management;process management framework;data science team;lean Kanban philosophy;structured iteration process;lean hypothesis testing;capability-based iterations;Kanban process;SKI;Scrum best practices;structured Kanban iteration framework","","6","","40","","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Societal changes, technological innovation and sustainability requirements call for improvements in flexibility and speed during the automotive development process. Traditionally, plan-based frameworks like the waterfall or Vee-model are used by the automotive industry. However, these frameworks do not work well for all suppliers that partake in the automotive product development process. An agile or hybrid framework may offer a better alternative for specific suppliers. To create an innovative, digital and adaptive product development process, this research aims at the integration of the whole value chain. This includes the requirements of the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and their suppliers. To allow for simple usage and adaptation, the knowledge is processed into a digital reference model. This generic reference model is then used to derive specific development processes that consider the context of each partner. By integrating communication mechanisms, it ensures that all partners can use their preferred framework for their development process while still ensuring a consistent product. In order to be able to select the most appropriate framework according to the context of a specific partner, the reference model takes into consideration all contextual factors of the development process.","","978-1-7281-7037-4","10.1109/ICE/ITMC49519.2020.9198437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9198437","Automotive;product development process;reference model;agile processes;hybrid processes;adaptive models;interorganizational communication","Planning;Automotive engineering;Industries;Adaptation models;Logic gates;Supply chains;Automobiles","agile manufacturing;automobile industry;innovation management;product development;production engineering computing;production planning;sustainable development;technology management","adaptive reference model;agile frameworks;hybrid frameworks;car industry;societal changes;technological innovation;sustainability requirements;plan-based frameworks;Vee-model;automotive industry;automotive product development process;OEM;original equipment manufacturer;digital reference model;Germany;waterfall model","","","","49","","16 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, the successful implementation of scrum—the most diffused APM methodology—seems related to the project teams’ subculture, which may differ from the overall organizational culture of the company. This article contributes to the APM literature in nonsoftware contexts by studying the cultural values that develop inside agile teams and the scrum principles and practices that are particularly relevant for fostering these values. Using interview data collected from seven manufacturing and service organizations, we use the competing value framework as the theoretical model to understand the cultural profiles of their organizations, how they deploy into the project teams’ subculture, and what, if any, connections exist with the adoption of scrum principles and practices. We find that clan and market values are the dominant subcultures in agile teams. These cultural values are fostered at a strategic level by a subset of scrum values (i.e., courage, openness, and respect) and pillars (i.e., transparency and adaptation). At an operational level, retrospective meetings and the definition of particular artifacts also contribute to develop these dominant cultural values.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2022.3146717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9711919","Agile methodologies;competing value framework (CVF);organizational culture;scrum","Companies;Cultural differences;Software;Interviews;Industries;Philosophical considerations;Planning","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper emphasizes how to improve management and estimation challenges in the context of scrum, which is an agile process widely used for the development of small to medium size software projects. The scrum emphasis on code results in spending inadequate time on the estimation process. Mostly, the scrum master, along with the scrum team, estimates the upcoming software projects based on experience or historical data. Many issues can arise in a case where expert judgment is not available or historical data are not properly organized. In this paper, an Intelligent Recommender and Decision Support System (IRDSS) is proposed that can help the scrum master to better estimate an upcoming software project in terms of cost, time, and recommendations of human resources. Formal specification of IRDSS is also performed using the formalism known as Z language. Furthermore, an experiment on fifteen web projects was performed to validate the proposed approach and compared it with Delphi and Planning Poker estimation methods. The overall results indicate that the proposed system can produce better estimation than Planning Poker and Delphi methods by applying MMRE and PRED evaluation.

Elaborated innovation management, marketing and customer relation processes are used to understand the need of the customer (market pull) and the new technical possibilities (technology push). The design and implementation of such innovation management processes is complex in itself and well researched. This paper extends the state-of-the-art with a focus on the interfacing between the systems engineering process (for the product development) and the innovation management process (for the ideation and innovation creation). We propose a parallel, interlinked execution of both processes instead of the over-the-fence practice where an innovation idea is handed over to product development at a certain point of time. A continuous interaction of both processes with agile management methods reduces the risk of getting the wrong product. Instead of using wrong or outdated information in the product development due to the missing updates from innovation management, a continuous linking and exchange mechanism with the systems engineering project is proposed. Interlinking these two complex processes is addressed with scenario-based methods and a process similar to BizDevOps. The full paper will evaluate the concepts based on a complex eMobility case study.","2770-4254","978-1-6654-2605-3","10.1109/IDAACS53288.2021.9661020","BMWi(grant numbers:01ME20002C); BMBF(grant numbers:02J19B090); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9661020","Systems of Systems;Agile Management;Innovation Management","Technological innovation;Conferences;Fitting;Data acquisition;Innovation management;Product development;Requirements engineering","formal specification;innovation management;product development;project management;systems analysis;systems engineering","agile Systems engineering;requirements engineering;good requirements;complex systems engineering processes;highly elaborated systems engineering processes;elaborated innovation management;customer;technical possibilities;innovation management process;systems engineering process;product development;ideation;innovation creation;innovation idea;agile management methods;wrong product;systems engineering project;complex processes;scenario-based methods;complex eMobility case study","","","","19","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agile methods promise code quality improvement, but while embracing the agile methods, software development organizations have realized that defects still do exist and must be managed. When the development is distributed over several sites, defect management can become even more challenging. In this study we analyzed defect data in a large multi-site organization during the first twelve months of their agile transformation. Complementing information was gathered by a survey, which was conducted in the organization twice: after six and after twelve months of starting the agile transformation. The results indicate that the defect reporting practices changed after the agile adoption was started, the defect inflow was more stable and the defect closing speed improved.","","978-1-4244-8539-0","10.1109/QUATIC.2010.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654786","Defect management;quality;agile transformation;distributed software development","Organizations;Programming;Software;Measurement;Indexes;Testing;Personnel","software development management;software quality","agile methods;software defect data;defect reporting practices;software development projects;code quality improvement;multisite organization;agile transformation","","3","","29","","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We analyzed transcriptions of eight daily meetings from two software development teams. The agile literature states that the daily meeting should focus on answering questions such as ""What have I done? What will be done? What obstacles are in my way?"" However, on average, only 24% of each of the meetings that we studied focused on this task. We found that 35% of the meeting was spent on elaborating problem issues and discussing possible solutions. Very little time was used for coordinating tasks. Our results indicate that many project decisions are made in daily team meetings and that this quick decision making requires team members to be experts.

From these studies we find a number of opportunities for A) software engineering methods and tools such as Domain Specific Languages to play a role in abstracting from underlying computing complexity, and for B) new architectures to increase efficiency and availability of deployment.

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective search-based approach to support the team in making such a decision. Our approach employs evolutionary techniques to iteratively generate candidate selections of issues for a given iteration, and search for the optimal selection(s). The search is guided simultaneously by two objectives: maximizing the business value which the team delivers in the iteration while maximizing the alignment with regard to the iteration's original goal.

UAVs with this capability have begun to emerge in the literature with advances in lightweight sensing and computing. Although the planning methodologies vary from platform to platform, many algorithms adopt a hierarchical planning architecture where a slow, low-fidelity global planner guides a fast, high-fidelity local planner. However, in unknown environments, this approach can lead to erratic or unstable behavior due to the interaction between the global planner, whose solution is changing constantly, and the local planner; a consequence of not capturing higher-order dynamics in the global plan. This work proposes a planning framework in which multi-fidelity models are used to reduce the discrepancy between the local and global planner. Our approach uses high-, medium-, and low-fidelity models to compose a path that captures higher-order dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. In addition, we address the interaction between a fast planner and a slower mapper by considering the sensor data not yet fused into the map during the collision check. This novel mapping and planning framework for agile flights is validated in simulation and hardware experiments, showing replanning times of 5-40 ms in cluttered environments.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-6027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2019.8794248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794248","","Planning;Trajectory;Computational modeling;Vehicle dynamics;Robot sensing systems;Optimization","autonomous aerial vehicles;collision avoidance;mobile robots;sensors","low-fidelity models;fast planner;planning framework;agile flights;replanning times;cluttered environments;multifidelity models;autonomous navigation;real-time localization;lightweight sensing;planning methodologies;hierarchical planning architecture;low-fidelity global planner;high-fidelity local planner;erratic behavior;unstable behavior;global plan;higher-order dynamics;real-time planning;sensor data;collision check;UAV;time 5.0 ms to 40.0 ms","","13","","29","","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The authors discuss how this approach enabled small teams to build energy-efficient, cost-effective, and industry-competitive high-performance microprocessors in a matter of months. Their agile methodology relies on rapid iterative improvement of fabricatable prototypes using hardware generators written in Chisel, a new hardware description language embedded in a modern programming language. The parameterized generators construct highly customized systems based on the free, open, and extensible RISC-V platform.

To find further suitable practices, teams start to follow the tailoring approach by choosing only the fragments of different methods that fit their needs and context. Many tailoring approaches have been proposed by orienting different aspects such as process, resource and goal. While the interaction between team members is very important in agile methods, none of these approaches focuses on the socio-intentional aspect. In the literature, we can find many case studies that link socio-intentional aspects to the tailoring of agile practices. Even though it is helpful to know it, locating relevant information can be effort and time-consuming. This research proposes a socio-intentional framework that can analyze agile practices and indicate how to tailor them with the help of an evidence-based tool and a modeling language. This framework will allow practitioners to identify the right practices to achieve their goals and analyze their suitability and vulnerability.

However, the most pertinent ones are not always selected depending on the resources available, which could result in failed projects. In fact, several reports show a high rate of failure in software projects. The type of development methodology chosen is one important factor when differentiating between successful from unsuccessful projects. For example, it has been reported that projects that use agile practices have a greater percentage of success. However, agile methodologies are not necessarily appropriate for any type of project. Given the above, a development methodologies recommendation system prototype was developed, that allows guiding developers with low experience or knowledge to select more appropriate methodologies according to different criteria. These criteria were obtained from bibliographic sources and then validated and complemented through an empirical study where surveys were applied to professionals of companies that develop software in Chile.","1522-4902","978-1-5386-9233-2","10.1109/SCCC.2018.8705156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8705156","Recommender systems;development methodologies;decision rules;software development","Software;Instruments;Silicon compounds;Analytical models;Recommender systems;Industries;Prototypes","DP industry;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping","software industry;software development methodologies;software projects;failed projects;agile practices;agile methodologies;recommendation system prototype;recommender system","","1","","20","","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, tailoring of the scrum master role is investigated. The scrum master acts as a facilitator for software development teams, nurturing adherence to agile practices and removing impediments for team members. But in large projects, scrum masters often work together in geographically distributed teams. Scrum masters use sprint planning to avoid development tasks that overlap team boundaries, coordinate status and effort across teams, and integrate code bases. The study comprises 8 international companies in London, Bangalore and Delhi. Interviews with 46 practitioners were conducted between February 2010 and May 2012. A grounded theory research method was used to identify that the scrum master role comprises six activities: process anchor, stand-up facilitator, impediment remover, sprint planner, scrum of scrums facilitator, and integration anchor. This systematic description of activities in scrum master teams extends our understanding of practitioner perspectives on agile process tailoring in large enterprises. Understanding these activities will help coaches guide large scale agile teams.","2329-6313","978-1-4799-4360-9","10.1109/ICGSE.2014.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915249","Agile software development;scrum;large enterprise systems;scrum master;grounded theory","Companies;Software;Interviews;Scrum (Software development);Software engineering;Programming","organisational aspects;outsourcing;software development management;software prototyping","process anchor;stand-up facilitator;impediment remover;scrums facilitator;integration anchor;large scale agile teams;grounded theory research method;Delhi;Bangalore;London;code bases;sprint planning;geographically distributed teams;team members;agile practices;software development teams;outsourced enterprise projects;large-scale offshore enterprise projects;agile method;process tailoring;scrum master activities","","26","","47","","2 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This influence led to project-based companies becoming market-oriented in their projects to achieve more success. However, the convergence of project management and marketing is still controversial. In this context, this study aims to assess the relationship between the vision of marketing, through conscious and unconscious processes, and its influence on the success of projects. Conscious processes deal with controlled and deliberate cognitive evaluations of anything, while unconscious processes are those that occur without one's control and awareness. These mechanisms occur in parallel and influence our beliefs and behavior. Forty-five professionals working on projects participated in the survey. We collected the data through a structured questionnaire, to the conscious process, and a computerized task for the unconscious data using an instrument called Project Marketing Implicit Association Test. Thus, the study presented analyzes on how project managers conceive their conscious and unconscious perception of how marketing and project management can reconcile into a theoretical and practical convergent concept. The results provide evidence of a positive and significant influence of conscious and unconscious processes on project success. It was also revealed that these processes act independently, enhancing the project's success.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3023897","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Brazil Coordenaçço de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) - Financing Code(grant numbers:001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195418","Cognitive process;market orientation;project management;success in projects","Project management;Companies;Task analysis;Cognition;Stakeholders","cognition;marketing;project management;psychology","project management success;cognitive process lens;market-oriented;unconscious processes;conscious process;controlled evaluations;deliberate cognitive evaluations;project managers;conscious perception;unconscious perception;project marketing implicit association test","","2","","63","CCBYNCND","14 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The essence of the study is to establish under what conditions the volume of project implementation (area) will be the largest, and the cost of resources (sides of the rectangle) will be the smallest. According to the results of the study it is established that of all the rectangles that determine the possible states of the project, only the square has the largest area with a minimum length of the perimeter (resource costs). To provide optimal solutions for correcting the deviation of the actual states from the planned ones, adaptive control is substantiated by calculating the smoothed value at the adjustment point as the arithmetic mean, planned, actual and predicted values.","","978-1-6654-1978-9","10.1109/E-TEMS51171.2021.9524904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524904","smart city transformation;project management;adaptive process of managing complex projects;visual model structure;uncertainty in project;time-cost balancing model","Adaptation models;Solid modeling;Smart cities;Project management;Europe;Planning;Research and development management","adaptive control;costing;planning;project management;smart cities;town and country planning","graphical interpretation;execution time;resource costs;project management time-cost balancing model;smart cities transformation;time-cost balancing management model;complex smart city transformation projects","","","","23","","1 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To facilitate a rational and efficient planning process, release planning models make such factors explicit and compute release plan alternatives according to optimization principles. However, experience suggests that industrial use of such models is limited. To investigate the feasibility of model and tool support, we compared input factors assumed by release planning models with factors considered by expert planners. The former factors were cataloged by systematically surveying release planning models, while the latter were elicited through repertory grid interviews in three software organizations. The findings indicate a substantial overlap between the two approaches. However, a detailed analysis reveals that models focus on only select parts of a possibly larger space of relevant planning factors. Three concrete areas of mismatch were identified: (1) continuously evolving requirements and specifications, (2) continuously changing prioritization criteria, and (3) authority-based decision processes. With these results in mind, models, tools and guidelines can be adjusted to address better real-life development processes.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-0445-0","10.1145/1985793.1985901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032518","agile;case study;large development projects;practitioners' mental models;repertory grid;scrum","Planning;Biological system modeling;Software;Programming;Interviews;Couplings;Systematics","grid computing;optimisation;planning (artificial intelligence);software engineering;software management","model-based release planning;judgment-based release planning;incremental software projects;incremental software development;rational planning process;optimization principles;industrial use;tool support;expert planners;surveying release planning models;repertory grid interviews;software organizations;substantial overlap;relevant planning factors;continuously evolving requirements;continuously evolving specifications;continuously changing prioritization criteria;authority-based decision processes;real-life development processes","","8","2","33","","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This was validated by a case study on a capstone project in a Scrum course. This paper summarizes the positive results of introducing agile coaching, which resulted in approximately 22% more coverage of software engineering practices.

From customer's perspective, the activity of continuous requirements reprioritization forms the very core of today's agile approaches. However, the freedom for clients to do so does not come for free. This paper presents results of a literature review on agile requirements prioritization methods, derives a conceptual model for understanding the inter-iteration prioritization process in terms of inputs and outcomes, and identifies issues and solutions pertinent to agile prioritization. The latter are derived from the authors' experiences and by using empirical data, published earlier by other authors.","","978-1-4244-4083-2","10.1109/IWSPM.2008.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797428","","Programming;Variable speed drives;Decision making;Project management;Scalability;Computer architecture;Delay;Application software;Product development;Conferences","decision making;formal specification;formal verification;product development;project management;software development management;software maintenance;systems analysis","dynamic requirements reprioritization;agile software product development;requirements engineering;software evolution;agile requirements prioritization;conceptual model;inter-iteration prioritization process;decision making;project management","","29","","28","","4 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Without realizing it as a regular and well-defined standard approach, companies perform it on an ad-hoc basis. Due to which, process tailoring could not be developed into a formal process and approach to managing software development, processes and projects. Software development process paradigm shift from conventional software development approaches to the agile methodologies left many companies struggling with the reusability of the existing processes and defining new processes from scratch. Limited work on process tailoring and lack of a formal approach, particularly for overwhelmingly used agile methodologies, affected the acknowledgment of this process. Addressing this limitation, present research work formulates a process tailoring framework to tailor agile-based software development processes. The proposed framework recommends tailoring three key processes of agile methodologies based on the project state considering the client's perspective and requirements. The existing literature have been reviewed to develop a theoretical framework which is verified and validated through structured interviews and case study of real projects. The framework provides a formal and a structured approach to tailor agile-based processes and methodologies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8849986","Agile processes;process tailoring;processes;software development","Software;Companies;Interviews;Standards;Guidelines;Focusing;Licenses","project management;software development management;software prototyping;software quality","agile-based software development processes;formal approach;software development management;software development companies","","4","","87","CCBY","26 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Increased complexity of infrastructure projects needs such management approach which takes the (increasing) complexity into account. Literature sheds light on importance of flexibility in project management while practice of project management in construction industry seems to be less flexible. The gap between what literature advises and what practice does, triggered us to look into the practice and see whether it aligns with literature or not. Hence the objective of this research was to explore the flexibility of project management in practice in the frontend phase of infrastructure projects. By means of a semi-structured questionnaire we asked practitioners to rate their last-completed project based on its management flexibility. In order to do so, we gave the participants a list 26 identified flexibility enablers from literature and asked them first to pick (in general) the 5 most important and 5 least important flexibility enablers. Next we asked them to rate the project management of the selected project based on those 10 picked enablers. By qualitative analysis of data gathered from 43 respondents from The Netherlands it reveals that the practice of project management has some degree of flexibility which implicitly has taken into action. Our research results can help practitioners to take the full advantage of flexibility in project management by making (more) explicit what they do implicitly. For further research it is recommended to test the practical applicability of flexibility enablers in case studies, explicitly investigating the suggested links to project performance.","","978-1-5386-1639-0","10.1109/STC-CSIT.2017.8099425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8099425","flexible project management;infrastructure projects;construction industry","Project management;Planning;Uncertainty;Organizations;Bibliographies;Construction industry;Complexity theory","construction industry;project management;small-to-medium enterprises","project management;infrastructure projects;construction industry;Netherlands","","1","","26","","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on scientific literature research, initial suggestions of relevance factors show that not all processes are equally relevant for all project categories, enabling IT project managers of classical projects, as well as agile IT project managers, to focus their efforts on the most relevant processes. Processes of integration management, resource management and communication management in particular have been identified as being more relevant for project success than other processes.

A specific characteristic of SEAP is that it includes a security group consisting of four different competences, i.e., Security manager, security architect, security master and penetration tester. Another significant feature of SEAP is an integrated risk analysis process. In analyzing risks in the development of the mobile money transfer system, a general finding was that SEAP either solves risks that were previously postponed or solves a larger proportion of the risks in a timely manner. The previous software development process, i.e., The baseline process of the comparison outlined in this paper, required 2.7 employee hours spent for every risk identified in the analysis process compared to, on the average, 1.5 hours for the SEAP. The baseline development process left 50% of the risks unattended in the software version being developed, while SEAP reduced that figure to 22%. Furthermore, SEAP increased the proportion of risks that were corrected from 12.5% to 67.1%, i.e., More than a five times increment. This is important, since an early correction may avoid severe attacks in the future. The security competence in SEAP accounts for 5% of the personnel cost in the mobile money transfer system project. As a comparison, the corresponding figure, i.e., For security, was 1% in the previous development process.","","978-1-4673-6590-1","10.1109/ARES.2015.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299894","Security;risk analysis;software development;agile method;industrial setting","Security;Software;Risk analysis;Agile software development;Mobile communication;Testing;Guidelines","financial data processing;mobile computing;risk analysis;security of data;software engineering","security-enhanced agile software development process;industrial setting;SEAP;mobile money transfer system;Ericsson Corp;integrated risk analysis process;baseline development process;software version","","24","","18","","19 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One widely accepted definition of software architecture is that it is a composition of a set of architectural design decisions. Hence, designing a software architecture is a decision-making process. Agile methods drastically changed the way of designing a software architecture. In projects using agile methods (e.g. Scrum), making architectural design decisions is not the responsibility of a single person, but rather the whole development team. Despite the popularity of such methods in the industry, little research exists on how to make these decisions from the perspective of a group effectively. Current techniques usually focus on the identification of quality attributes and design alternatives, not addressing the whole decision-making process. The quality of decisions directly reflects the quality of the software architecture. Therefore poor decisions lead to bad software architectures. In this paper, we discuss current research on group decision-making in software architecture and the proposal of a combination of concepts from two architecture definition methods into a single approach that can be used in agile projects and addresses the most critical concerns of group decision-making. This proposal is part of a master's research project.","","978-1-5090-4793-2","10.1109/ICSAW.2017.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7958489","software architecture;group decision-making;agile;Scrum","Decision making;Stakeholders;Software architecture;Computer architecture;Collaboration;Conferences;Industries","decision making;software architecture;software prototyping;software quality","architectural design group decision-making;agile projects;software architecture;quality attributes;design alternatives;software quality","","","","23","","26 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An ontology system is proposed that combines the ontology for information support of the requirements engineering process and the ontology of the software product application domain. So we offer to analyze the requirements as logical statements about the application domain of the software product. The method of extracting and analyzing the requirements from natural Russian language formulations is described. The requirements are first processed by the UDPipe as a part of the method. Production rules for extracting ontology concepts are applied to the dependency trees built by UDPipe. The consistency of the requirements set presented in the form of the ontology instances is checked according to the developed production rules. The paper also gives a brief description of the developed decision support system (DSS) prototype which involves the joint use of several OWL files presenting knowledge about the project, the application domain and the semantic relations between the key elements of the proposals with the requirements (actors, actions and objects). The ontology editor Protégé 5.2 is used to work with the ontology. The DSS is written in Python. DSS can exchange data with adjacent systems SWI-Prolog and UDPipe.","","978-1-7281-7041-1","10.1109/ITNT49337.2020.9253232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9253232","ontology;agile software development;requirements engineering","Decision support systems;Analytical models;Agile software development;Production;Ontologies;Software;Requirements engineering","decision support systems;formal specification;ontologies (artificial intelligence);PROLOG;software product lines;software prototyping","intelligent support;agile software development;ontology system;information support;requirements engineering process;software product application domain;natural Russian language formulations;UDPipe;ontology concepts;ontology instances;production rules;decision support system prototype;ontology editor Protege 5.2;OWL files;DSS;Python","","1","","18","","12 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since each project is unique, the landscape between the current state (the start of the project) and the desired state (the successful end of the project) is often dynamic, uncertain, and ambiguous. Conventional project plans define a set of related activities (a work breakdown structure and activity network) with the assumptions that this set is necessary and sufficient to reach the project's desired result. Popular models for project planning (scheduling, budgeting, etc.) and control are also based on a set of project activities that are specified and scheduled a priori. However, these assumptions often do not hold, because, as an attempt to do something novel, the actual path to a project's desired result is often revealed only by the additional light provided once the work is underway. In this paper, we model a product development process as a complex adaptive system. Rather than prespecifying which activities will be done and when, we set up: 1) a superset of general classes of activities, each with modes that vary in terms of inputs, duration, cost, and expected benefits; and 2) simple rules for activity mode combination. Thus, instead of rigidly dictating a specific project schedule a priori, we provide a “primordial soup” of activities and simple rules through which the activities can self-organize. Instead of attempting to prescribe an optimal process, we simulate thousands of adaptive cases and let the highest-value process emerge. Analyzing these cases leads to insights regarding the most likely paths (processes) across the project landscape, the patterns of iteration along the paths, and the paths’ costs, durations, risks, and values. The model also provides a decision support capability for managers.

The purpose of adopting software development methodologies is to optimize the process model to achieve milestones while concurrently and effectively managing time, budget, and quality. The literature review reveals that there is a lack of statistical evidence for determining the effect of both methodologies on the six-pointed star model (schedule, scope, budget, risk, resource, and quality). In this paper, statistical comparisons were performed for the effects of both methodologies on each factor of the six-pointed star model and the interdependency among factors. Numerical analyses were conducted based on survey responses collected from the experienced users of both methodologies.

Therefore, agile methodology helps in modeling these user requirements through user stories iteratively and incrementally. However, this can only be done through continuous prioritization. This prioritization is essential for meeting the budgetary constraints and time to market deadlines, and is done by the Product Owner (PO) on the basis of Business Value without considering the dependence of one story on other due to execution order. This dependence can be understood by visualizing the process flow using UML Activity Diagram. The conversion of user requirements into UML Diagram can be done via NLP. Once the UML is ready, it helps to prioritize the stories according to process flow. This paper aims to provide an approach to tackle the issue of prioritization considering both the business value and process flow aspects and help the PO in making decisions about which requirements to be considered first and arranging them in Product Backlog.","","978-1-5386-0926-2","10.1109/ICACCT.2018.8529454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8529454","Agile;User Stories;Product Owner;Business Value;UML;NLP;Product Backlog","Unified modeling language;Stakeholders;Libraries;Registers;Agile software development;Task analysis","software prototyping;Unified Modeling Language","user stories;continuous prioritization;business value;agile software development;business needs;UML activity diagram;user requirements;product owner;NLP;product backlog","","3","","21","","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Scrum is an iterative, collaborative, and flexible process to develop a software product. Scrum projects welcome changes at any stage of a project, but such changes significantly affect project management activities and quality, including time and budget overrun. These changes also compromise architectural integrity. The objectives of this research were: 1) to determine how product backlog changes are managed by practitioners in Scrum projects, and 2) to explore the perception of practitioners on the use of requirement traceability for product backlog and project risk management during requirement volatility in Scrum. In this research, we conducted a survey among Scrum practitioners and obtained 89 complete responses through our electronic questionnaire. The practitioners identified the reasons of backlog changes and recorded the changed elements. Majority of practitioners recorded modified requirement as “new requirement,” but they made changes in the original product backlog. The practitioners tended to agree that requirement traceability was helpful in managing product backlog and minimizing project risk. However, majority of the respondents pointed out the lack of specific requirement traceability method for Scrum.","","978-1-4673-8227-4","10.1109/MySEC.2015.7475219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7475219","Agile Scrum;product backlog;requirement volatility;requirement traceability","Software;Scrum (Software development);Risk management;Schedules;Size measurement;Time measurement;Predictive models","management of change;project management;risk management;software prototyping","product backlog change management;software product development;Scrum projects;requirement traceability;project risk management;requirement volatility;agile software development methodology","","10","","26","","23 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper addresses and overcomes the major issues of transparency, trust, security, traceability, coordination, and communication in DASD by embedding blockchain technology. We have proposed a novel blockchain-based framework named as AgilePlus which executes the smart contracts on a private ethereum blockchain for acceptance testing, secure payment, verification of developer’s payment requirements, and automatic payment distribution into the digital wallets of development teams. The execution of these smart contracts automatically assign penalties to the customers for late or non-payments and also to the developers for overdue tasks. Moreover, we have also solved the blockchain’s scalability challenge in AgilePlus by utilizing Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as off-chain storage. Lastly, experimental results prove that the proposed framework enhances transparency, communication, coordination, traceability, security and solves trust issues of both customers and developers in DASD.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3146953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9694597","Distributed agile software development;blockchain technology;ethereum blockchain;smart contracts;interplanetary file system","Blockchains;Security;Software;Smart contracts;Collaboration;Testing;Decentralized applications","blockchains;contracts;distributed processing;DP industry;electronic money;file organisation;groupware;mobile computing;project management;software prototyping","smart contracts;private ethereum blockchain;automatic payment distribution;development teams;security;trust issues;DASD;distributed agile software development;geographically independent software development;traceability;project deal cancellations;payment clashes;software industry;interplanetary file system;AgilePlus","","","","34","CCBY","27 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, traditional service composition or mashup are somewhat unavailable due to complex relations and heterogeneous deployed environments. For the purpose of building cloud-enabled mobile applications in a configurable and adaptive way, Model-Driven Development Patterns based on semantic reasoning mechanism are provided towards CoT application development. Firstly, a meta-model covering both multi-view business elements and service components are provided for model transformation. Then, based on formal representation of models, three patterns from different tiers of Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework are used to transform business models into service component system so as to configure cloud services rapidly.

The study is using a simulation that provides the “players” with the realistic events of individual project scenarios in order to enhance their decision-making skills. The simulation system concentrates on possible risk events that occur during a project's execution phase, the challenges facing the project managers and the evaluation of their decisions. The game is designed for several teams competing among themselves. One hundred and twenty four undergraduate students participated in this test while they studied advanced project management course.

In response, this article presents a management flight simulator that represents a digital twin of set-based design, design change, knowledge, and agile project management practices. It integrates discipline-specific submodels through key linkages that are derived from the intrinsic properties of a system case study and intangible assets such as knowledge, communication, culture, and process maturity. It captures the techno-socio-economic and cultural factors involved in design change decisions and project management. The simulator provides immediate feedback on whether a change is going to help or disrupt design integrity through the monitoring of system attribute trends and cues. It also provides the impact on lifecycle management curves using a system dynamics submodel. From this feedback, several system, policy, and process levers are available within the simulator for what-if scenarios with the goal to improve product, organizational, and project performance.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.3006747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9145681","Decision-making;digital twin;integration;knowledge management;multiattribute;multidomain;project management;robust design;set-based design;simulator;social network analysis (SNA);system dynamics (SDs);systems engineering;system-of-systems (SoS)","Schedules;Project management;Delays;Decision making;IP networks;Knowledge engineering;Tools","aerospace simulation;decision making;design engineering;organisational aspects;project management;socio-economic effects;software development management;systems engineering","systems engineering;traditional project management models;product information;set-based design;agile project management practices;discipline-specific submodels;system case study;techno;cultural factors;design change decisions;design integrity;system attribute trends;cues;lifecycle management curves;system dynamics;project performance;project management flight simulator;schedule delays;complex projects","","","","35","IEEE","21 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Emotional infection is considered as a social and psychological mechanism of transferring the mental mood of the manager to other stakeholders of the innovative communication project, emotional impact in the face of direct contact, and the inclusion of the individual in certain mental states that affect the effectiveness of management. In times of crisis, the emotional behavior of the innovation communication project manager and his infection with the project team is exacerbated by external uncertainty. The stakeholder infection model is based on an understanding of the life cycle of the project manager, which is presented as a curve for personal changes of the manager of innovative communication projects and programs. Emotions are considered in content, reflecting the various aspects and meanings that caused them. To apply the psychophysiological formula for assessing the impact of the emotional state of the stakeholders of innovative communication projects, these influences have been transformed into a competent model for managing these projects.

Combining them to create a hybrid legged-wheeled locomotion results in increased speed, agility, and reconfigurability for the robot, allowing it to traverse a multitude of environments. The CENTAURO robot has these advantages, but they are accompanied by a higher-dimensional search space for formulating autonomous economical motion plans, especially in cluttered environments. In this article, we first review our previously presented legged-wheeled footprint reconfiguring global planner. We describe the two incremental prototypes, where the primary goal of the algorithms is to reduce the search space of possible footprints such that plans that expand the robot over the low-lying wide obstacles or narrow into passages can be computed with speed and efficiency. The planner also considers the cost of avoiding obstacles versus negotiating them by expanding over them. The second part of this article presents our new work on local obstacle pushing, which further increases the number of tight scenarios the planner can solve. The goal of the new local push-planner is to place any movable obstacle of unknown mass and inertial properties, obstructing the previously planned trajectory from our global planner, to a location devoid of obstruction. This is done while minimising the distance traveled by the robot, the distance the object is pushed, and its rotation caused by the push. Together, the local and global planners form a major part of the agile reconfigurable navigation suite for the legged-wheeled hybrid CENTAURO robot.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139438","CENTAURO H2020 European Union (EU) Project(grant numbers:644839); Italian/Singapore MoD Project PHOLUS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9665773","Hybrid legged-wheeled navigation;legged-wheeled robotics;navigation among movable objects;path planning;quadrupedal robot;reconfigurable navigation planning","Robots;Legged locomotion;Navigation;Planning;Robot kinematics;Wheels;Collision avoidance","collision avoidance;legged locomotion;mobile robots;motion control;path planning;robot kinematics;wheels","cluttered environments;movable obstacle;legged locomotion;standard methods;legged-wheeled locomotion results;increased speed;reconfigurability;higher-dimensional search space;autonomous economical motion plans;legged-wheeled footprint;global planner;wide obstacles;local obstacle pushing;local push-planner;local planners;global planners;agile reconfigurable navigation suite;legged-wheeled hybrid CENTAURO robot","","","","42","CCBY","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An undergraduate capstone project typically involves a student development team as well as other stakeholders such as faculty advisors and industry mentors. Given that the agile development approach is adopted, a sprint review is conducted at the end of each sprint to demonstrate and critique the features that the development team have completed. Unlike the industrial settings, capstone design students can be challenged when conducting agile sprint reviews. On the one hand, the availability of industry mentors is unpredictable due to their own business commitments and schedules. On the other hand, it is extremely hard to bring all stakeholders together in one meeting. To overcome these difficulties, in our practice we have employed two strategies. First, we used a so-called agile buddy approach which allows each team to acquire an outsider student's opinion on their system. Second, we adopted a web-based collaboration platform such that students can collect critiques asynchronously from different stakeholders.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658435","Agile buddy;Agile development;Capstone projects;teamwork","Industries;Software;Stakeholders;Unified modeling language;Collaboration;Schedules","computer aided instruction;computer science education;further education;groupware;Internet;project management;software prototyping;team working","undergraduate capstone project;student development team;industry mentors;agile development approach;capstone design students;agile buddy approach;agile sprint reviews;faculty advisors;Web-based collaboration platform","","1","","31","","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Scrum or scrum variants form a high performance, collaborative team to handle projects that are more complex. We examine the applicability of the scrum framework to a large-scale revenue management system for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). Industry believes integration and acceptance testing is not easy to perform within the scrum framework. Nevertheless, very little is explored about the acceptance testing in Agile practices. We fill this gap by empirically evaluating UAT of a complex, large-scale system (in a public sector organization) to showcase the applicability of scrum framework. While the initial UAT team consisted of 100 domain experts, no process was defined for the UAT. This made it easier to streamline the UAT into the scrum framework. Once the scrum framework was introduced significant improvements in the UAT team was experienced with improved morale, productivity, efficiency, and time to market while having a smooth flow.","","978-1-5090-0645-8","10.1109/MERCon.2016.7480122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7480122","agile practice;agile testing;scrum framework;user acceptance testing","Testing;Software;Stakeholders;Productivity;Interviews;Training","program testing;software houses;software prototyping","agile practices;acceptance testing;scrum framework;large-scale revenue management system;user acceptance testing;UAT;complex-large-scale system;public sector organization;morale improvement;productivity improvement;efficiency improvement;time-to-market improvement","","4","","14","","30 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In healthy agile environments, people see a lot of value in the collection of metrics and in their collaborative analysis to support a continuous improvement process. In pseudo agile environments, metrics are often perceived as a threat and they make people uncomfortable. In theses conditions, they can do more harm than good. In this paper, we argue that the acceptance of a data-driven continuous improvement process is heavily influenced by the nature of the channels through which the metrics are published. We argue for the need to go beyond typical dashboards and propose additional engagement channels.

In this study, we investigated students' build behaviors in agile software development PBL (SDPBL) by monitoring and collecting logs of the build process from 2013 to 2016. In our investigation, we collected two types of logs, the local build logs collected by each student's build in their own local programming environment, and remote build logs collected by any team member's commit in team repository. Based on our analysis of the build logs from 2013 to 2015, we found that the causes of remote build errors are related to both technical factors and communications among students in a team. In 2016, the instructors tried to educate to students the reason why the remote build error occur and how it can be resolved. As a result, in 2016, the number of remote build errors and the time required to solve the build errors decreased compared to previous years.

"Scrum2Kanban: Integrating Kanban and Scrum in a University Software Engineering Capstone Course","C.

This usually means students are introduced to and work with the currently most popular agile methodology: Scrum. However, as the agile methods employed in the industry change and are adapted to different contexts, university courses must follow suit. A prime example of this is the Kanban method, which has recently gathered attention in the industry. In this paper, we describe a capstone course design, which adds the hands-on learning of the lean principles advocated by Kanban into a capstone project run with Scrum. This both ensures that students are aware of recent process frameworks and ideas as well as gain a more thorough overview of how agile methods can be employed in practice. We describe the details of the course and analyze the participating students' perceptions as well as our observations. We analyze the development artifacts, created by students during the course in respect to the two different development methodologies. We further present a summary of the lessons learned as well as recommendations for future similar courses. The survey conducted at the end of the course revealed an overwhelmingly positive attitude of students towards the integration of Kanban into the course.","","978-1-4503-5750-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8442128","Agile methods;capstone course;Scrum;Kanban","Software;Scrum (Software development);Education;Industries;Schedules;Servers","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;kanban;project management;software prototyping;teaching","Scrum2Kanban;university software engineering capstone course;university capstone courses;agile software development methodologies;professional software development;university courses;Kanban method;capstone course design;capstone project;agile methodology;development methodologies","","","","33","","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel, use-case driven framework for a modular 5G service design and delivery is proposed. The framework implements agile and as-a-service principles to provide 5G use-case customers access not only to service usage, but also to design and operation. The framework integrates with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifications by mapping network-slicing procedures to the designed ecosystem lifecycle operations. The framework allows for the any-technology deployment, utilizing the available foundations for domain-specific automation. A structured collaboration between a 5G operator and a use-case user allows for the customization and improvement of the targeted use-case, where 5G network assets are updated with customer's vertical components through programmable user-stories.

We conducted a case study at ING and analyzed historical log data from 765,200 user stories and 571 teams to identify team factors characterizing delayed user stories. Based on these factors, we built models to predict the likelihood and duration of delays in user stories. The evaluation results show that the use of team-related features leads to a significant improvement in the predictions of delay, achieving on average 74%-82% precision, 78%-86% recall and 76%-84% F-measure. Moreover, our results show that team-related features can help improve the prediction of delay likelihood, while delay duration can be explained exclusively using them. Finally, training on recent user stories using a sliding window setting improves the predictive performance; our predictive models perform significantly better for teams that have been stable. Overall, our results indicate that planning in agile development settings can be significantly improved by incorporating team-related information and incremental learning methods into analysis/predictive models.","2643-1572","978-1-6654-0337-5","10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678939","effort estimation;team dynamics;agile software development","Learning systems;Training;Analytical models;Agile software development;Predictive models;Software;Stability analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);planning;project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","delivery performance;delays;software deliveries;765 user stories;200 user stories;team factors;team-related features;delay likelihood;delay duration;recent user stories;predictive performance;incorporating team-related information;modeling team dynamics;agile software development;proper team structures;effort estimates;on-time delivery;software projects","","1","","77","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the majority of data science projects still fail to deliver the expected value. To increase the success rate of projects, the use of process models or methodologies is recommended in the literature. Nevertheless, organizations are hardly using them because they are considered too rigid and they do not support the typical iterative and open nature of data science projects. To overcome this problem, this research suggests applying Agile methodologies to data science projects. Agile methodologies were originally developed in the software engineering domain and are characterised by their iterative approach towards software development. In this study, we selected the Scrum approach and integrated it into the CRISP-DM methodology for data science projects using a Design Science Research approach. This new methodology was then evaluated in three different case organizations using expert interviews.

Its impact is felt in families, organisations and communities. The impact on organisations and particularly working environments is still largely an unknown. Part of the working environment entails the way project teams should be managed. Speed and agility are required to implement the various technologies that form the underlying basis of the 4th Industrial Revolution. This requires project teams and project managers to adjust their behaviour. This article focuses on the various leadership styles and those that are more appropriate for the implementation of these new technologies. A survey was conducted amongst South African project managers to determine their level of servant-leadership and 621 responses were analysed. The analysis focused on servant-leadership attributes. The results determined that five attributes of the servant-leadership style are important but that in general, South African project managers still focus on a `command and control' type of leadership. The article contributes to the current debate on the best ways to manage project teams during the 4th Industrial Revolution. The jury is still out on the best working environment and the results indicate that a servant-leadership style is most appropriate but that project managers are not embracing this leadership style. This might have to do with training that they have had. Current project management best practices and competencies do not focus on this new way of working and organisations and project management bodies need to address this concern.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939367","Agile software development;Industry 40;project management;servant-leadership","Leadership;Industries;Project management;Collaboration;Software;Economics","human resource management;organisational aspects;personnel;project management","industrial revolution;industry 4.0-related projects implementation;project managers;servant-leadership style;servant-leadership attributes;South African project managers","","7","","51","CCBY","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Is the cost of missing documentation greater than the cost of producing unnecessary or unused documentation? Even without these documents, software engineers maintain other software artifacts, such as tickets in an issue tracking system (ITS) or source code committed to a version control system (VCS). Do these artifacts contain the necessary knowledge? In this paper, we examine undocumented knowledge in an agile software development project at NTT. For our study, we collected 159 commit logs in a VCS and 102 tickets in the ITS from the three-month period of the project. We propose a ticket-commit network chart (TCC) that visually represents time-series commit activities along with filed issue tickets. We also implement a tool to generate the TCC using both commit log and ticket data. Our study revealed that in 16% of all commits, software engineers committed source code to the VCS without a corresponding issue ticket in the ITS. Had these commits been based on individual issue tickets, these ""unissued"" tickets would have accounted for 20% of all tickets. Software users and requirements engineers also evaluated the contents of these commits and found that 42% of the ""unissued"" tickets were required for software operation and 23% of those were required for requirements modification.","2332-6441","978-1-5386-3191-1","10.1109/RE.2017.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048905","Agile Agile Development;Issue Tracking System;Version Control System;Requirements Knowledge","Software;Agile software development;Documentation;Tools;Data visualization;Knowledge management","configuration management;formal specification;formal verification;project management;software development management;software prototyping;source code (software);system documentation","unissued tickets;requirements engineers;undocumented knowledge;industrial project;issue tracking system;version control system;agile software development project;software artifacts;source code;ticket-commit network chart;time-series commit activities;commit log;requirements modification","","4","","23","","25 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the EOSs with optical sensors particularly, the observation mission is significantly influenced by the uncertainty of cloud coverage, which has been identified as the most dominant factor for the invalidation of remote sensing images. To overcome this uncertainty, uncertainty programming methods, namely, chance constraint programming (CCP), stochastic expectation model, and robust optimization, are put forth. Despite their success, these approaches are limited in that they simplified the complex cloud coverage uncertainty, which may be different from the true cloud conditions, and they did not take the true cloud information into consideration. Motivated by these recent trends toward Big Data of satellite cloud images and machine learning for spatiotemporal prediction, this article explores a dynamic replanning scheme for multiple EOSs based on cloud forecasting. Specifically, we propose a new approach mainly in the following three steps: first, proactive scheduling based on a CCP is implemented and uploaded via ground control; second, cloud forecasting can be continuously conducted relying on the predictive recurrent neural network and the latest satellite cloud image; and third, mission replanning can be conducted according to the initial schedule and relatively accurate cloud information. Simulation results show that the cloud forecasting method is effective, and the replanning approach presents highly efficient and accurate scheduling results.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3135529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9652077","Agile Earth observation satellite (AEOS);artificial neural network;cloud forecasting;mission replanning;uncertainty programming","Clouds;Planning;Uncertainty;Forecasting;Satellites;Earth Observing System;Earth","artificial satellites;clouds;constraint handling;geophysical image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;path planning;planning;recurrent neural nets;remote sensing;scheduling;stochastic processes","multiple agile Earth observation satellites;mission planning;optical sensors;remote sensing images;uncertainty programming methods;CCP;stochastic expectation model;complex cloud coverage uncertainty;satellite cloud images;dynamic replanning scheme;multiple EOSs;latest satellite cloud image;cloud forecasting method;replanning approach","","","","48","CCBY","15 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to overcome this problem, the common concept of Change Request is separated in the existent Engineering Change Request (technical) and the Project Change Request (management). The Project Change Request (PCR) is presented as a solution not only to allow the PMP to be defined earlier, according to Project Management (PM) good practices, but also to manage changes on project documents as the project evolves.

However, user stories do not suffice for understanding the big picture of system requirements. While there are methods that try to solve this problem, they lack visual tool support and are too heavy for smaller projects. We have earlier proposed a novel agile agent-oriented modelling (AAOM) method for filling this gap. The AAOM method comprises a visual approach to requirements engineering in agile projects that is based on goal models originating in agent-oriented modelling and connects goals intuitively to user stories. The purpose of the study reported in this article was evaluating the AAOM method for requirements engineering in two real-life case studies.

We provide a detailed analysis of the key practices, with a preliminary assessment of the ease of implementation for each. An analysis of a number of the difficulties involving transitioning from a traditional waterfall software development process to Agile practices will show that, though difficult, a transition is possible. The transition to Agile development does not require sudden, sweeping change, but instead can be accomplished through incorporating Agile methods into an existing process. We will document successful integration of test-driven development, pair programming, refactoring, an iterative approach, and other Agile methods into a traditional DO-178B software development process.

This facilitates customer-oriented results and reduces the risk for failures based on misunderstandings. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, most companies reduced office times and encouraged their employees to work from home in order to protect people from infection. Direct face-to-face communication was replaced by online meetings using video conferencing, chats, and cloud-based collaboration. This significantly changed the way of working. While online-based tools for remote collaboration were familiar to many employees before, others were reluctant to use them in the past. The sudden need to utilize these tools in order to be able to participate in business at all opened such tools for people who would not have used them under normal conditions. In this article, the results of a recent study are presented, in which the impact of the pandemic on agile working is examined. Based on these results, a scenario of the future of agile working in a post COVID-19 world is derived. The study was conducted as an online survey in Germany. More than 170 people working in different job positions and from different branches and companies participated. The study reveals that the pandemic significantly changed the way of working.

Proper application of software development methodologies assists software designers to run IT projects to the success of achieving the satisfaction of project stakeholders. Because of the issues raised by traditional software development methodologies such as the Waterfall model, the IT industry began to employ Agile methodology for IT project management. However, due to the separation of software development and operation teams, Agile methodology also caused problems. DevOps is a new approach adapted to the Agile methodology that collaborates the software development and operation teams in order to provide continuous development of high-quality software in a short period of time. However, there are practical issues reported since DevOps approach is still in its infancy in the IT industry. The purpose of this research is to analyze the use of the DevOps concept in IT Projects by evaluating the challenges and mitigating strategies practiced by software development firms in order to ensure the success of IT projects. This purpose was achieved by performing a literature study and soliciting recommendations from industry professionals using a questionnaire survey.

This experience report tells the story of a team that chose to start the project with Scrum, and then gradually and with continuous improvement in mind, deconstructed the process in order to better fit it's context.

Extreme programming (XP) embraces both communication and feedback as interdependent process values which are essential for projects to achieve successful results. Our research presents the empirical results from four different case studies. Three case studies had partially onsite customers and one had an onsite customer. The case studies used face-to-face communication to different extents along with email and telephone to manage customer-developer communication inside the development iterations. Our results indicate that an increased reliance on less informative communication channels results in higher defect rates. These results suggest that the selection of communication methods, to be used inside development iterations, should be a factor of considerable importance to agile organizations working with partially available customers. This paper also proposes some guidelines for selecting proper communication methods.","","0-7695-2562-8","10.1109/AGILE.2006.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667565","","Computer aided software engineering;Programming;Feedback;Communication channels;Collaborative work;Information processing;Communication effectiveness;Telephony;Guidelines;Software systems","software development management;project management;customer services","customer communication;agile software development;extreme programming;onsite customers;face-to-face communication;customer-developer communication;communication channels;development iterations;agile organizations","","24","","34","","14 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of modelling and simulation for ongoing analysis forms the backbone of various SoS Engineering (SoSE) methodologies, and many of the challenges that arise in SoSE apply equally to the modelling, simulation and analysis of complex integrated systems. Weapons and Combat Systems Division, in collaboration with other Australian Department of Defence agencies, is developing a modelling, simulation and analysis capability in order to investigate the performance of integrated defence systems. The execution of this development is being undertaken in the form of a “study series” based on the SoSE Wave Model and is composed of discrete sub-studies. Each of these sub-studies is used to progressively increase the complexity of the scenario being modelled (both number of systems being modelled and model fidelity) whilst performing analysis and answering questions for Defence stakeholders. This approach ensures regular and ongoing feedback and investment from client groups, and that the final modelling and simulation capability is fit-for-purpose to meet the strategic objectives. The study series operates on a yearly cycle of analysis where traditional model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approaches are employed to support the analytical and top-level model requirements definition. However, the developers of the various software models used within the study series commonly apply Agile-based methodologies, in accordance with current software engineering best practice. A hybrid methodology has been developed to manage this, incorporating components of more traditional MBSE tools and techniques at the study level, and Agile methodologies for model development. This paper describes this hybrid methodology, including how MBSE is utilised to manage an evolving, complex, SoS simulation capability, define study requirements, and integrate with an Agile software model development approach. The paper employs an unclassified aerospace example in which modelling and simulation-based analyses have been applied to explore how different Uninhabited Aerial System concepts could be implemented in concert with other platforms to enhance an Anti-Ship Missile Defence capability. The requirements definition approaches are explored from both the analysts' and model developers' perspectives.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438152","","Analytical models;Missiles;Tools;Stability analysis;Complexity theory;Modeling;Best practices","aerospace computing;computer simulation;military computing;missiles;software prototyping;systems engineering","analytical model requirements;MBSE;defence stakeholders;Australian Department of Defence agencies;Weapons and Combat Systems Division;SoS engineering;complex weapon systems of systems;SoSE wave model;top-level model requirements;agile software model development;uninhabited aerial system;anti-ship missile defence capability;simulation-based analyses;SoS simulation;software engineering;software models;model-based systems engineering;integrated defence systems;complex integrated systems;agile methodologies","","","","14","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The production scheduling process is a complex problem in which finding a suitable production scheduling can greatly increase the effectiveness of highly flexible production processes. Nevertheless, this high flexibility makes the production scheduling and acquisition of relevant data quite complicated. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a universal and flexible tool for production scheduling capable of increasing the utilization of resources and that supports a decision-making process for the selection of production orders. In this paper, a flexible and adaptive scheduling tool (FAST) to develop an adaptable, fault-tolerant, and scalable scheduling system for a manufacturing environment is presented.

Over the years, a number of Agile practices have been invented. These practices are built on the same Agile principles but emphasise on different rationales and values, and thus associated with various approaches, activities and artefacts. Given this variety, and necessity for organizations to incorporate Agile, many studies have attempted to examine the relationship between organizational attributes, particularly organizational culture, and Agile practices, which in configurations result in effective outcomes of software development. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that deals with an alternative way in which organizations identify their cultural types, and understand underlying principles of each Agile practice in order to form the fit between organizational culture and Agile. In other words, organizations do not necessarily change their current culture in order to use Agile effectively, as existing studies suggested. Rather, they select the Agile practice that fits with their cultural type. This framework is based on interpretation of existing literature and systematic qualitative approaches.","","978-1-5090-2033-1","10.1109/JCSSE.2016.7748915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748915","","Software;Organizations;Unified modeling language;Planning;Software engineering;Cultural differences","organisational aspects;software prototyping","agile practices;organizational cultures;software engineering methodology;software development;agile principles;organizational attributes;systematic qualitative approach","","2","","37","","21 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are several scholarly articles that provide details on how Agile development methodologies like scrum and DevOps rely on automated testing for security. The majority of literature on the subject recommend manual security and penetration testing, but there is currently no objective measure to determine when this manual testing should take place. In Agile scrum and in DevOps, manual security testing is usually conducted after a large feature is completed and integrated into production. If a correlation can be found between aspects of software changes and their propensity to introduce vulnerabilities into a software application, then that data can be used to build an objective process for measuring when manual security testing should be performed in Agile development.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458121","Agile Development;Software Testing;DevOps;Vulnerability;SDLC","Software testing;Correlation;Scientific computing;Manuals;Production;Tools;Software systems","program testing;security of data;software maintenance;software prototyping","software security vulnerability;security posture;software systems;software changes;software releases;DevOps;software application;automated testing;penetration testing;Agile scrum;security testing;agile development;quantitative quasiexperimental study","","","","28","","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use Game Theory in a simulated Agile development environment. We run 28 iterated games with 56 practitioner and student participants. Stand-up meetings are used as the communicat ion in tervent i on compared to games without such meetings to assess the levels o f trust. Our findings are that increased communication has a very large positive effect upon the level of trust between team members in an Agile setting.

It is no different in South Africa. Senior management and owners of organisations should treat the issue as a strategic imperative in their organisations. Failure to do so might render an enterprise uncompetitive, with the result that its market share starts diminishing within the sector. The planners in an enterprise must recognise that each of the products manufactured will require a different strategy to compete with competitors' products. Various factors influence the capabilities of an enterprise in the SMME sector, the most important being supply and demand insecurity, life cycle of products and capacity. It could have a detrimental effect on an organisation's competitiveness. Awareness of the strategic importance of Agile/lean supply chain management is essential if an enterprise within the SMME sector is to remain competitive. Consequently, planners in the sector must achieve the correct balance between the competing factors described above. Implementation of agile/lean strategies for supply chain management within the enterprise concerned would enable it to deal with any fluctuations it might experience. The paper will attempt to illustrate the applicability of a hybrid agile/lean approach in the enterprise concerned.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-39-7","10.23919/PICMET.2019.8893823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8893823","","","agile manufacturing;lean production;organisational aspects;product life cycle management;small-to-medium enterprises;strategic planning;supply and demand;supply chain management","South Africa;SMME sector;organisational aspects;supply chain management;manufacturing capability;supply and demand insecurity;product life cycle;market share;hybrid agile-lean strategies;competing factors","","","","46","","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many factors, ranging from team size to music listened by developers, have been studied regarding their effect on productivity. Surprisingly, little is known about how the dynamics of open-source projects that use agile practices are related to the productivity of the developer teams. Our study aims to close this gap by analyzing the productivity of open-source projects using measures that are popular in the context of agile software development. To do this, we study data from seven open-source projects and calculated both the individual velocity of developers and focus factor of teams per iteration. First, we applied statistical process control to identify iterations with out-of-control velocity and focus factor values. Then, we studied these iterations regarding four context factors that partly characterize the dynamics of open-source projects, i.e., iteration length, turnover of developers who left, turnover of new developers, and team stability index. Our results suggest that high team stability and low turnover are strongly associated with iterations showing high velocity.","","978-1-7281-9532-2","10.1109/SEAA51224.2020.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9226278","Agile Software Development;Open Source;Productivity;Turnover;Team Performance","Productivity;Open source software;Stability criteria;Indexes;Velocity measurement;Agile software development;Software measurement","project management;public domain software;software development management;software prototyping;software quality;team working","open-source software projects;agile practices;agile software development;open-source projects;focus factor value;out-of-control velocity value;team stability index","","4","","32","","16 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper continues to describe an outline of Agile and Lean development methodologies and the design of the Lunar Lion team and the Puma prototype. The paper also discusses program requirements, system implementation, and the results of using an Agile-Lean process for hardware development. The Penn State Lunar Lion team designed a low-cost landed mission to the surface of the Moon. This lander is designed to autonomously execute mission activities and collect valuable science data targeting lunar exploration goals set by the science community. Currently, Lunar Lion's team of geoscience students is developing a viable set of science goals for a small lander. For the propulsion system and vehicle design, a notional 30 kg science payload was assumed in the calculation of mission parameters. To achieve the final 300 m/s descent and landing delta-V, the team considered a monopropellant, hydrogen peroxide system; they performed analysis for thrust levels, Isp requirements, throttle range, and total propellant loading. The team identified readily available, low-cost hydrogen peroxide rocket engines that use a proprietary blend of precious metals for the catalyst and subsequently purchased several fitting rocket engines. Students then performed initial testing to confirm performance characteristics, and fed the engine specifications forward into the design of a prototype for earth-based operations. Lunar Lion uses the Agile approach to development by defining tasks and deliverables in Scrums and by using a Kanban project board to monitor progress. Merging the two methods allows for several key program management benefits such as centralized documentation resources, increased peer-to-peer interaction, and rapid turnaround of deliverables. It is this blend of Agile and Lean constructs that have directly led to the recent success of the Lunar Lion program. During the 160-day period that the team followed the Agile-Lean approach, the team successfully reached two challenging technical milestones: multiple full-scale, vehicle-level static fire tests and the system's first tethered 1-DOF vertical takeoff and soft landing test. This paper concludes with projected next steps, as well as a discussion of the effectiveness of the team's use of Agile methods and its applicability to future student-focused technology development projects.","","978-1-5090-1613-6","10.1109/AERO.2017.7943584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943584","","Moon;Engines;Valves;Propulsion;Prototypes;Space vehicles;Testing","aerospace propulsion;aerospace testing;entry, descent and landing (spacecraft);lunar surface;planetary landers;propellants;rocket engines","small planetary lander;agile prototype development;monopropellant planetary landing system;hybridized agile-lean development method;lean development methodologies;lunar lion team design;Puma prototype;Penn State lunar lion team;Moon surface;lunar exploration;propulsion system;vehicle design;landing delta-V;descent delta-V;hydrogen peroxide system;low-cost hydrogen peroxide rocket engines;Kanban project;key program management;multiple full-scale tests;vehicle- level static fire tests;1-DOF vertical takeoff;soft landing test","","","","15","","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developing and managing the different requirements engineering phases of product lines present is a dilemma that the efforts done in the literature was not able to effectively and efficiently resolve. To realise the full potential of agile product line engineering in practice, a complete, consistent, correct, and unambiguous user requirements must be produced without investing that huge amount of time in the upfront domain engineering phase of a traditional software product line. In this proposal, a behaviour-driven cloud-based framework is introduced to develop and maintain software product lines in an agile-based environment. The approach relies on upfront automated testing to derive and manage core assets and variations of an agile-based software product line.

Agile software development has departed from traditional approaches, such as the Waterfall model. Much research has been conducted on adopting agile software development for either distributed or collocated projects. However, little research has discussed organisational boundaries between developers who use an agile software development approach and their customers. The purpose of this paper is to introduce agile software development to those organisations that develop software products for different distributed customers and also to study the potential impact of introducing Agile development across those organisational boundaries. We proposed a framework for developing software across organisational boundaries. This would ultimately address and accommodate key factors in software development across organisational boundaries using an agile development approach. This research will help the development society and serve as a guide for project managers, developers, stakeholders, and users to understand agile software development and the impact of adopting an Agile approach across organisational and cultural boundaries in their projects.","","978-1-908320-05-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6285001","Society;organisational;cultural boundaries;agile software development;framework","Software;Educational institutions;Planning;Collaboration;Documentation;Cultural differences;Global communication","cultural aspects;organisational aspects;software prototyping","product software development;product software specialisation;organisational boundaries;cultural boundaries;distributed customers;waterfall model;agile software development;project managers;developers;stakeholders","","1","","10","","27 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is a great challenge to provide timely assessment and feedback to project teams and individual students with a frequency that catches up with iterative, incremental, and cooperative software development with continuous deliveries. Conventional project reviews are mostly dependent upon instructors and teaching assistants in a manual reviewing/mentoring approach, which are simply not scalable. In this paper, we argue that agile projects warrant a ""continuous delivery"" of personalized assessment and feedback. To this end, we propose an online-offline combined approach and built a system upon GitLab. An online platform was built by integrating DevOps tool chains so that personalized reports and assessments are delivered automatically to the teams/students, which serve as the very efficient trigger and basis for the close and targeted offline interactions between students and TAs: daily discussion over instant messaging and weekly in person meeting. This system has been in operation since 2014 for an undergraduate SE course, with over 500 students participating in over 130 project teams in total. Our results show that such a continuous assessment/feedback delivery system is very effective in educating Agile projects in SE courses.","","978-1-4503-5660-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445183","Software Engineering Course;Project;Agile;DevOps;Assessment","Tools;Software engineering;Measurement;Testing;Software;Education;Collaboration","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;feedback;groupware;Internet;project management;software prototyping;teaching","timely assessment;individual students;cooperative software development;continuous delivery;conventional project reviews;teaching assistants;personalized assessment;online-offline combined approach;undergraduate SE course;software engineering courses;continuous assessment-feedback delivery system;agile software engineering projects;agile development;project teams;manual reviewing-mentoring approach;GitLab;integrating devops tool chains","","","","10","","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There were too many roles and hierarchy levels with information consistency problems in between. Prioritization of the high-level goals was unclear and made it difficult to plan and organize development work based on business value. The trace from high-level goals to more detailed plans was easily corrupted due to poor planning practices. Progress monitoring of daily work was poorly done and not linked to high-level plans.

Herein we connect theory and practice to advance a computational model that provides objective-based assessments of communication plans and helps managers weigh tradeoffs of cost, time, and quality in the use of communication channels across the project. We draw on adaptive structuration theory to understand the impetus to utilize technology in group settings and media richness to explain the capabilities of channels that offer rich synchronous platforms (for e.g., phone, face-to-face, and web conference) and asynchronous lean approaches (for e.g., email, message board, and archive).

But inappropriate use of risk assessment and decision making processes can still affect task completion during a project. New management methodologies must therefore be developed that enhance knowledge sharing by considering the viewpoints of more experts, supporting ad-hoc communications between partners and improving secured integration of technologies. Not only could time management become more efficient because the managers would have a broader, deeper understanding of the decisional context, but it could also minimise investment risks by enabling fast reactivity to any unforeseen issues. Based on the above requirements, the pro-active project management is introduced here as a solution to current project management limitations. It makes full use of advanced technologies, such as virtual reality, to enable knowledge sharing at any time between any members of a project. After an analysis of current issues, this paper thus introduces the pro-active project management methodologies and the technologies that enable its implementation. It finally shows how such a methodology helps achieving efficiency in a project.","","978-0-7695-3652-1","10.1109/I-ESA.2009.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5260793","project management;collaboration;methodology","Project management;Decision making;Risk management;Conference management;Knowledge management;Technology management;Monitoring;Process planning;Application software;Communication system control","decision making;knowledge management;planning;project management;risk management;time management;virtual reality","pro-active project management;task planning;task controlling;risk assessment;decision making processes;ad-hoc communications;time management;investment risk minimisation;virtual reality;knowledge sharing","","4","","21","","25 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The software quality has been considered as an important term in software industry since the beginning of the software development. According to the researchers study one of the software development process that overcomes the challenge of quality is agile process. Agile is a process that focuses more on continuous integration (CI), proving quality of product in a quantifiable manner. But still researchers are not able to prove it quantitatively. This research paper presents a framework that engages in modelling and measuring agile quality attributes so that practitioners can focus their efforts on most critical attributes and thus achieving higher quality. The framework uses Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) for modelling and measuring various agile quality attributes. ISM helps in developing interrelationship among these attributes. The paper, discuss key concept of ISM approach and the proposed framework optimizes the process of enhancing the overall quality by identifying most critical agile quality attributes having higher driving power.","","978-1-5090-1489-7","10.1109/ICRITO.2016.7785028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785028","Agile process;Quality attributes;Interpretive Structural Modelling;Structural Self Interaction Matrix;Reachability Matrix","","","","","8","","32","","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are often reported to be a problematic issue for agile projects, since ASD methods tend to neglect NFRs while focusing on incremental delivery of functional features. Despite that, only very few studies have explored the requirements engineering practices used in ASD and dedicated particularly to NFRs. Objective: We aimed to identify and investigate the practices used in industrial ASD projects to identify, elicit and document NFRs. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) and used its findings to prepare an interview guide. We then conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 10 experienced practitioners. Results: The SLR revealed a number of strategies related to the timing of NFR identification as well as 13 elicitation practices and 20 documentation techniques. At least some of these findings show discrepancies between ASD theory and practice. The interviews provided a more in-depth understanding of the practices used, and their context. The main findings from the interviews include: practitioners’ attempts to start identifying NFRs early in the project, a lack of elicitation techniques aimed at NFRs only, and different choices about documentation techniques, including the additional techniques introduced to cope specifically with NFRs. Conclusions: It was not confirmed that requirements engineering activities related to NFRs are perceived by ASD practitioners as a problem, as they developed effective practices to deal with this issue. Moreover, our findings show that different approaches to NFRs can be used and give satisfactory results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9371679","Requirements engineering;non-functional requirements;agile software development;systematic literature review;interviews","Requirements engineering;Documentation;Software;Interviews;Agile software development;Systematics;Focusing","","","","4","","88","CCBY","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Though these phases normally require customer availability on-site, this type of involvement might be difficult with globally distributed projects where customer's location is different from team members' location. The traditional methods of customer involvement in distributed agile projects such as using the rich communication technologies (e.g. video-conferencing solutions) are commonly used. The problem with these methods is that team members may not recognize how their technical work requires customer involvement. Even if they know, they might forget to inform the customer or there might be a considerable time between the need for customer involvement and the nearest meeting with him. In addition, the review of the available mechanisms of customer support in thirty-six project management tools reveals a lack of computer-based support for customer involvement. This paper presents a research in-progress which aims to support the effective management of customer involvement in distributed agile teams. It proposes computer-based process support for managing customer involvement which can improve the meaningful communication between customer and agile team and improve customers' awareness with regard to the state of activities in which he participates in.","2329-6313","978-1-5090-3625-7","10.1109/ICGSEW.2016.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7579478","Global Software Development;Project Management Agile;Process;Tool","Software;Testing;Collaboration;Project management;Planning;Electronic mail","software management;software prototyping","computer-based process support;thirty-six project management tools;acceptance testing;requirement analysis;distributed agile software projects;customer involvement","","3","","17","","29 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We conclude that knowledge required to be transferred across projects in an IT service enterprise includes two main categories of project process knowledge and project product knowledge, the former of which involves subcategories of business domain knowledge, project engineering knowledge, project management knowledge and organization management knowledge. These categories of knowledge are characterized by tacit ness, generality, hierarchy and valuability. Our study contributes to existing research by focusing on cross-project knowledge transfer and what is transferred, different from the existing studies mainly investigating knowledge transfer within the same project team. Results of the study can provide not only managerial implications to the development and utilization of knowledge and skills for IT service enterprises, but also theoretical preparation for further research on cross-project knowledge transfer.","","978-1-4577-1419-1","10.1109/ICM.2011.139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113635","IT service enterprise;cross-project knowledge transfer;knowledge;characteristics","Knowledge engineering;Knowledge transfer;Project management;Organizations;Educational institutions;Context","knowledge management;organisational aspects;project management","IT service enterprise;cross-project knowledge transfer;project performance enhancement;qualitative analysis;project process knowledge;project product knowledge;business domain knowledge;project engineering knowledge;project management knowledge;organization management knowledge","","2","","16","","29 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, merely using processes/tools in the practices does not necessarily result in “achieving agility”, especially for those who have been using a waterfall model. They tend to think that the waterfall model is the only way. This mindset is the main obstacle to make the introduction of agile practices successful. To derive a true value in using them, understanding the underlying mindset in the agile practices is essential. This report introduces a novel workshop-based learning course to understand the agile mindset. The course participants create pipe cleaner arts for experiencing pseudo software development in two different models: waterfall and agile. A questionnaire result from total 201 participants shows that they perceived a clear difference between the two models.

Current studies found that the majority of the e-government project failure was caused by change management. E-government as object of project is a complex object, since it involves not just only information technology (IT), but also people, processes, government policies and legislation, bureaucracy, organizational structure, and etc. Since currently existing models of change management are still generic models for IT projects, it is necessary to formulate a change management model for e-government projects. The model aims to provide a guideline for government and e-government project practitioners in developing and implementing an e-government project in order to be accepted by the target users, to achieve the project targets, and to support the organization's goals. The proposed model is formulated by identification of the characteristics of e-government projects in Indonesia.

The goal of this research paper is to study the effect of manager personality and task nature on management effort. To achieve our aims, we relied on a dataset that consists of detailed data, which forms distinct decision situations, methods and outcomes from 1,144 participants from distinct backgrounds. The dataset was gathered from an interactive game called the Agile Manager Game platform (AMG). The variables utilized in our dataset were manager personality (age, education and gender) and task difficulty. We applied a statistical analysis to our dataset using IBM SPSS which is flexible and relies on machine learning techniques, and we utilized different classifiers of different types. These classifiers are Naïve bayes, IBK, Decision tree J48 and AdaBoostM1. We applied also k-means clustering approach to our dataset. These classification and clustering techniques were applied using the well-known toll which is called WEKA. The results showed that task nature and manager education are considered significant determinants of management effort. However, manager personality age and gender do not affect management effort.","2573-3346","978-1-6654-8097-0","10.1109/ICICS55353.2022.9811211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9811211","Waterfall;Project management;Agile;Scrum;DSDM;Decision making","Statistical analysis;Communication systems;Education;Estimation;Project management;Games;Machine learning","","","","","","36","IEEE","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, very few gamification proposals were evaluated with Scrum teams in practice. In this paper, we present a software tool based on gamification to make Scrum techniques more fun and engaging for practitioners. As a result, practitioners should increase their motivation to apply Scrum techniques in practice, which in turn might result in more and better software.

For, adapters to address this problem, agility assessments have been designed to be aware of the situation of their transition and make sure that they are heading in the right direction. However, these assessments still require significant amount of time and effort to apply. To overcome this problem, we have developed a web-based agility assessment tool which is a part of an integrated agility assessment approach.

Finding an optimal solution for these decision-making situations is a difficult task without some kind of automated support, as there are many possible alternative work allocation solutions and each solution affects the cost and duration of project differently. To assist project managers in these situations, we propose a tool for planning GSD projects.

In agile development contexts, there is often a balancing act between documenting the design decisions in detail and keeping the documentation efforts to a level tolerable for the project. To this end, we present the notion of High-level Design stories (or HLDs), as small, modular artifacts that record the main design decisions and their context, but also include information about architecture assumptions, quality-attribute analysis, and pending issues for the system. HLDs are intended to be created and refined during the different phases of an architecture-centric development process, and assist in the validation of the decisions (and pending issues) in that process. This way, a global (although detailed) architecture design can be obtained from the combination of the HLDs. In this work, we discuss the pros and cons of using HLDs for design decisions based on experiences from an industrial software project.","","978-1-7281-1876-5","10.1109/ICSA-C.2019.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8712373","design decisions;architecture knowledge management;documentation;design reviews;agile development","Computer architecture;Documentation;Stakeholders;Software;Software architecture;Companies","knowledge management;software architecture;software development management;software prototyping;software quality","High-level Design stories;architecture-centric agile development;architecture knowledge management;system stakeholders;system implementation;agile development contexts;documentation efforts;architecture assumptions;pending issues;architecture-centric development process;HLD;design decisions;industrial software project;quality-attribute analysis","","","","18","","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We argue that we should consider having at least two databases: one support transactional capabilities and the other support reporting and possible data warehouse needs, and will show how such an approach supports the Agile software development methodology.","","978-9-8975-8124-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7293857","Software Development;Agile Software Development Process;Databases;Database Management Systems;MongoDB;NoSQL","Agile software development;Software;Business;Relational databases;Servers;Database systems","","","","","","9","","8 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose to use a value-based approach and shift the discussion from the conventional solution space to the goal (value) space. Further we recommend an impact estimation approach for identifying current practice state (agile positioning) and a corresponding approach for navigating through the value (and solution) space as well as ways to visualize the results.

Network functions virtualized in the data centers spread to the metro nodes, IP, and optical technologies must cooperate to meet the metro traffic aggregation role. Multiple technological options exist, and carriers confront the need to economically assess them, benchmarked in realistic deployments. This paper gives relevant insights to this aim. We first construct a set of metro network benchmarks. A strategic and distinctive effort is made to incorporate metro WDM topologies, traffic profiles and daily variation patterns, fault-tolerance requisites, and network operational choices, that faithfully reflect the expected 5G metro progression for a national carrier. Then, we use these networks to assess two technological choices. On one hand, the cost-effectiveness limits in terms of CAPEX reductions and energy efficiency brought from the possibility of having an agile control plane in the metro, capable of on-demand instantiation of IT and network resources. On the other hand, we investigate the benefits of replacing ROADMs by more cost-effective filterless technologies, but just limiting this replacement to degree-1 and degree-2 optical nodes, that are prevalent (e.g. >50%) in regional metro topologies. A novel capacity planning algorithm has been developed for IT, IP and optical resources allocation and dimensioning, providing fault-tolerant designs for the realistic scenarios defined. Simulation results have been obtained using the Net2Plan NIW (NFV over IP over WDM) open-source framework. Developed algorithms and part of the testing scenarios are available for inspection in public repositories of the EU METRO-HAUL project, the umbrella for our work. Our results show CAPEX benefits in the order of 10% and energy savings in the order of 20-30% stemming from the on-demand resource allocation in the metro. In addition, degree 1 and degree 2 optical nodes have shown to be a sweet spot for applying filterless switching, with mitigated impact of the associated spectrum waste.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2020.2982131","European Commission(grant numbers:761727); INSPIRING-SNI(grant numbers:750611); MINECO; AEI; European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:TEC2017-84423-C3-2-P,RED2018-102585-T); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9042241","5G optical metro;agile control plane;filterless switching;techno-economic analysis","Optical filters;5G mobile communication;Optical fiber networks;Optical reflection;Benchmark testing;Wavelength division multiplexing;Topology","5G mobile communication;computer centres;fault tolerance;IP networks;optical fibre networks;resource allocation;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation;wavelength division multiplexing","techno-economic impact;data plane;agile control plane;5G optical metro;network functions;data centers;metro nodes;IP technologies;optical technologies;metro traffic aggregation role;metro network benchmarks;traffic profiles;fault-tolerance requisites;network operational choices;technological choices;cost-effectiveness limits;network resources;cost-effective filterless technologies;regional metro topologies;optical resources allocation;fault-tolerant designs;EU METRO-HAUL project;degree 2 optical nodes;optical metro network evolution;filterless data plane;5G requirements;metro WDM topologies;daily variation patterns;expected 5G metro progression;energy efficiency;CAPEX reductions;degree-1 optical nodes;Net2Plan NIW open-source framework;capacity planning algorithm;NFV over IP over WDM open-source framework;energy savings;on-demand resource allocation;filterless switching;associated spectrum waste;ROADMs","","19","","43","CCBY","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently separate studies have been conducted to understand how effort estimation is practiced in Agile Software Development (ASD) in co-located and distributed contexts. There is need to compare the findings of these studies. Objectives: The objective of this comparative study is to identify the similarities and differences in how effort estimation is practiced in co-located and globally distributed ASD. Method: We combined the data of the two surveys to conduct this comparative study. First survey was conducted to identify the state of the practice on effort estimation in co-located ASD, while the second one identified the same in globally distributed ASD context. Results: The main findings of this comparative study are: 1) Agile practitioners, both in co-located and distributed contexts, apply techniques that use experts' subjective assessment to estimate effort. 2) Story points are the most frequently used size metrics in both co-located and distributed agile contexts 3) Team's prior experience and skill level are leading cost drivers in both contexts. Distributed agile practitioners cited additional cost drivers related to the geographical distance between distributed teams. 4) In both co-located and distributed agile context, effort is estimated mainly at iteration and release planning levels 5) With regard to the accuracy of effort estimates, underestimation is the dominant for both co-located and distributed agile software development. Conclusions: Similar techniques and size metrics have been used to estimate effort by both co-located and distributed agile teams. The main difference is with regard to the factors that are considered as important cost drivers. Global barriers due to cultural, geographical and temporal differences are important cost and effort drivers for distributed ASD. These additional cost drivers should be considered when estimating effort of a distributed agile project to avoid gross underestimation.","","978-1-5090-4147-3","10.1109/IWSM-Mensura.2016.042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809614","","Context;Estimation;Variable speed drives;Software;Planning;Measurement;Companies","distributed processing;software cost estimation;software prototyping","globally distributed agile software development;colocated agile software development;software effort estimation;ASD;size metrics","","14","","20","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, the growing interdependence of the product software components within complex systems gradually evolves considerable challenge in terms of assessing system performance and planning for future system expansion. In addition, and equally important, establishing and maintaining performance modeling becomes more and more costly due to the increasing volatility of requirements. We should also consider the growing complexity of systems being built, integration with third party subsystems, and at the same time the fact that engineering teams face tight project budgets as businesses are looking to reduce capital expenditures.

In practice, when software companies make an attempt to adopt agile/scrum methods, the team is unwilling to alter their way of doing the day-to-day work. The mismatch between the processes makes the team very difficult to accept the new approach and ultimately regress to their former process - waterfall model.

It is important to find a middle ground between completely by-passing requirements documentation and writing a complete Software Requirements Specification. In this paper, we report our experiences, presenting a guideline for students and educators who wish to adopt motivational modelling, a lightweight approach to requirements elicitation and modelling, for agile requirements engineering. Motivational modelling is an efficient technique that also represents a good boundary object to support discussions between developers and non-technical clients. Finally, we outline discussion points regarding where motivational models could fit into other agile practices.","2164-0297","978-1-5386-8408-5","10.1109/REET.2018.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8501282","Requirements Engineering;Teaching;Agile;Motivational models","Education;Requirements engineering;Stakeholders;Software;Unified modeling language;Conferences;Industries","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;formal specification;formal verification;systems analysis;teaching","teaching motivational models;agile requirements engineering;excellent teaching curriculum;agile skills;teaching requirements engineering;by-passing requirements documentation;requirements elicitation;software requirements specification;software engineering courses","","8","","23","","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Release duration incorporates the expensive parts of the value chain: build, test, deploy and sell (but not exploratory design, for example). Release duration correlates with technical debt. Attempting to reduce release duration may help drive agile behavior through a company. Finance departments often collect release duration, helping a company assess its agility. Citrix Online illustrates how process methodology, development group size and release duration relate. Its adoption of Scrum and Enterprise Scrum drove release duration down from a peak of 41 months to less than 4, shorter than it had as a small startup. Its market share rose during the same period. Data from another company, Patient Keeper, also seems to indicate that short release durations correlate with more profitable outcomes.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-4892-0","10.1109/HICSS.2013.463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6480427","Scrum;Enterprise Scrum;Release Duration;Capitalization;Depreciation;Technical Debt;Engineering Management;Agile Practices","Companies;Software;Testing;Computer bugs;Finance;Manuals;Maintenance engineering","agile manufacturing;financial management;product development;production engineering computing","enterprise agility;release duration;measurable value;agile methods;value chain;technical debt;agile behavior;finance departments;company agility;Citrix online;process methodology;Enterprise Scrum;PatientKeeper;profitable outcomes","","4","","12","","18 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We conducted a study using an organizational culture framework to better understand both the ideal and current cultures of our department as well as the levers that can be used to move the current toward the ideal. The design of the study is based on the notion that by identifying an ideal culture and measuring the current culture we can identify the gap between the as-is and the to-be culture of the department. Our results demonstrate a marked difference between the target ideal culture identified by both the Agile experts and faculty/staff and what the students perceive the current culture to be.

Objective: This study aims at identifying primary studies that describe how startups are applying agile development practices and how they could benefit from these practices, thereby contributing to product quality improvement and better resource allocation. Method: A Systematic Mapping Study was conducted which applied automatic searches so as to identify relevant primary studies. Results: 60 primary studies were identified that present information regarding practices, challenges, and limitations of adopting agile development practices in startups and also the benefits, tools, and ways of simplifying their adoption. Conclusions: 55 agile development practices used by startups were found, the most cited ones being associated with DevOps, Test Automation, and Scrum. The main challenges and limitations are related to the difficulty of adapting legacy systems architecture to support DevOps practices, to market volatility, to the need for quick product release, and to resources, including financial resources, being limited. Benefits related to having improved internal processes were the most cited and 128 tools were classified.

For their development the industry needs highly-qualified and skilled employees. The employees need to have a wide breadth of knowledge in many engineering disciplines and possess excellent soft skills. Ideally, the needed skills are taught in practical settings. Problem: The versatility of the problems in development of cyber physical systems poses a challenge for the teaching. A common approach to teaching software engineering concepts is to have students form teams to create a software product; this allows them to experience the problems first hand. However, this approach, compared with ""traditional"" software engineering and software development, is much more difficult for cyber-physical systems, due to the need to have a wide understanding in multiple engineering fields. At the same time, the education of engineering concepts lack on teaching of soft skills that are often key success factors for engineering projects. Approach: We developed a novel task-centric holistic agile approach on teaching cyber physical systems. The concept is task-centric concluding five teaching approaches that may be used when needed. The concept focuses the teaching of technical skills and soft skills. Result: The proposed concept allows students to have an insight into the difficulties involved in development of cyberphysical systems from multiple points of view in a realistic way. Conclusion: The holistic agile approach on teaching cyber physical systems has the potential to reinforce conceptual instruction with hands-on learning at a fraction of the time and cost that would be required to run a true cyber-physical systems development project.","","978-1-5090-3474-1","10.1109/IECON.2016.7793806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7793806","Agile teaching;Cyber-Physical Systems;Education of Cyber-Physical Systems Engineering;Education of Global Software Engineering;Perceptional teaching;Problembased teaching;Project-based teaching;Research-orientated teaching","Education;Software;Robots;Software engineering;Cyber-physical systems;Physics;Paints","computer science education;cyber-physical systems;software engineering;teaching","task-centric holistic agile approach;cyber physical systems engineering;software engineering concept;software development;soft skills teaching;conceptual instruction;hands-on learning;cyber-physical systems development project","","12","","36","","22 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of its types is documentation debt, which can be identified by locating missing, inadequate or incomplete artefacts in software projects. Nowadays, we can observe more organizations using agile methods to support their activities. In particular, the use of user stories reduces the focus on requirement specification tasks and, as a consequence, creates difficulties that need to be overcame by the development team. In order to investigate these difficulties and assess whether they create a favourable scenario for incurring documentation debt, this paper presents the results of a literature review and an exploratory study. The results from both studies allowed us to identify a list of causes that can lead the development team to incur documentation debt when working with agile requirements. This is an important step in order to manage the technical debt from a preventive perspective.","","978-1-4799-8828-0","10.1109/ITNG.2015.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113503","Technical Debt;Documentation Debt;User Stories;Agile Requirements;Literature Review;Exploratory Study","Software;Documentation;Bibliographies;Protocols;Libraries;Software engineering;Estimation","formal specification;project management;software management;software prototyping;system documentation","technical debt;software projects;user stories;requirement specification;software development team;documentation debt;agile requirements;preventive perspective","","11","","28","","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In software development, agile methods are increasingly adopted in critical software projects where security risks are prominent challenges. This adoption stems from the fact that agile methods are highly iterative and support delivering services and products in smaller batches which allows security professionals to seamlessly integrate software development security activities with agile methodologies. In addition, the iterative nature of agile software development encourages frequent inspections, tests, and patching of software systems to mitigate cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. Considering the massive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) products, the challenge of software development while addressing the security and safety concerns of these devices will continue to increase. This paper presents a comprehensive and detailed review of agile software development in the context of IoT, ITS, and their cybersecurity and risk challenges.

In our work we propose and define an agile learning design method to support the design and creation of OERs. It is based on agile practices from software engineering and on practices of learning design from the OULDI project at the UK Open University. We illustrate our ideas with an experiment that validates the proposed method through its application in the design and creation of an OER in the software testing domain.

Even if these services solve operational issues, their adoption – because of their internal behavior – has a sustaining or non-sustaining impact on the (long term) strategy of the organization. This impact is called the Business and IT alignment (BITA); as such, it is problematic to estimate before the development of the service without a view on its design. To be properly done, BITA evaluation indeed needs details about the service run-time behavior. Conversely, the agile wave refrains from a detailed upfront software design; functions providing high operational value to users are indeed selected and built for one sprint at a time. The mismatch between a traditional service approach and an agile way of development is therefore quite obvious. The present paper proposes a method (called Agile-MoDrIGo) to reconcile these two approaches. For this purpose, it (i) decomposes services into epic user stories under the scope of which (user-level built) user stories can be mapped (i.e. functional alignment) and (ii) links services as (coarse-grained) conceptual elements along with the strategic objectives they sustain to fine-grained user story functional elements for value-driven prioritization (i.e. strategic alignment). The proposal is presented in the form of a meta-model and supported by a process fragment; it is validated on a case study in healthcare.","2378-1971","978-1-6654-2069-3","10.1109/CBI52690.2021.10066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9610701","Service-development governance;user stories;user story;agile-based services development;Business IT services;Scrum;middle-out development","Software design;Refining;Merging;Organizations;Medical services;Tools;Software","business data processing;formal specification;software architecture;software development management;Web services","service-orientation;meta-model;BITA evaluation;software design;Agile-MoDrIGo method;business IT services;agile development;business and IT alignment","","","","33","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The report also lays out the rationale for the agile approach to fixed-price contracts, and cites examples of successful implementations. The main challenges to successful delivery of agile projects under fixed-price contracts are as follows: Correct estimation of fixed-price agile projects; Misalignment between classical functional requirements and User Stories; Difficulty in handling change requests typical for agile projects with fixed budget; Differences between document-oriented and communication-oriented practices; Complexity of embedding specific agile projects into traditional (waterfall) customer environments; Tracking implemented scope and spent budget. The report also offers practical advice to address the aforementioned difficulties.","","978-1-4577-0606-6","10.1109/CEE-SECR.2010.5783180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5783180","Agile;SCRUM;Extreme Programming;fixed price;management","Materials;Contracts;Software;Electronic mail;Fires;Programming;Estimation","contracts;pricing;software prototyping","fixed price agile projects;corporate customers;fixed price contracts;classical functional requirements;user stories;document oriented practices;communication oriented practices","","2","","","","31 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Still, despite the fact that agile practices are increasingly used in critical domains, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating the occurrence of technical debt in critical software development projects. The results of an exploratory field study conducted across several projects reveal that a variety of business and environmental factors cause the occurrence of technical debt in critical domains. Using Grounded Theory method, these factors are categorized as ambiguity of requirement, diversity of projects, inadequate knowledge management, and resource constraints to form a theoretical model. Following previous studies we suggest that integrating agile practices, such as iterative development, review meetings, and continuous testing, into common plan-driven processes enables development teams to better identify and manage technical debt.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-5670-3","10.1109/HICSS.2016.668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7427856","Technical Debt;Software Development;Agile Methods;Grounded Theory","Interviews;Aerospace engineering;Companies;Software quality;Data analysis","knowledge management;project management;software development management;software prototyping","technical debt management;plan-driven process;continuous testing;review meetings;iterative development;resource constraint;knowledge management;project diversity;grounded theory method;environmental factors;business factors;agile practices;critical software development project","","1","","40","","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the operational mission for modern day systems is non-static, the engineering solutions must be sufficiently adaptive and evolutionary to meet these emerging challenges.

The challenge is that these new opportunities create a co-mingled architecture which is difficult to secure. The complexity of this architecture is magnified with the IoT. Based on interviews with executive leadership teams and boards of directors facing these new environments, we developed the over-arching research question: How do we secure increasingly dynamic architecture in an environment while supporting and creating agile business growth? We then narrowed this down to more specific questions dealt with in this study. The research involved an in-depth exploration of this problem using a survey instrument and multiple qualitative methods involving business leaders from 59 companies between 2017-2018. Based on this analysis, we developed an information security framework for executives in this new environment that builds on previous work. This framework is called the Extended Risk-Based Approach and provides businesses with an approach for securing an enterprise amidst the IoT and agile architecture. Importantly, the data analyzed suggests that this approach is critically needed to address the rapidly growing complexity of enterprise architecture and the digital world we live and work.","","978-1-5386-2047-2","10.1109/TEMSCON.2018.8488397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8488397","cybersecurity;cyber risk;IoT;Internet of Things;cloud computing;agile architecture","Companies;Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Computer security","business data processing;cloud computing;innovation management;Internet of Things;organisational aspects;risk management;security of data","agile business growth;cyber Risk;cloud computing;IoT;entrepreneurial businesses;disruptive business models enabling growth;co-mingled architecture;executive leadership teams;over-arching research question;dynamic architecture;business leaders;information security framework;Extended Risk-Based Approach;agile architecture;enterprise architecture;cost-effective IT infrastructure;digital world","","3","","25","","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to a high pressure on automotive software developers to deliver more and more complex software in ever faster innovation cycles. The classical development process of a car is a holistic and complex systems engineering approach which delivers a fully developed car (mechanics, electrics, electronics and software) after several years of development. This car will be produced (without major changes) for many years. The automotive industry mainly applies the V-model, a complex and much elaborated development process which systematically leads from a comprehensive set of requirements to a car which exactly fits the requirements. Very much different from this, agile development methodology starts with very fuzzy and uncertain requirements and drives the development via incremental improvements with close customer integration towards a product which might deviate a lot from the initial idea. For a number of reasons, this purely agile approach is not possible for automotive development. Therefore, ongoing research is conducted on integrating agile methods into the V-model – an approach which isn’t foreseen by the Agile Manifesto. Nevertheless, substantial progress is made and the automotive industry put big hopes into this approach. This contribution identifies four promising approaches for the integration of agile methods and principles into V-model. The approaches are analysed based on a literature review. A first set of hypotheses about the possible improvement and leverage for the automotive software development is developed. The hypotheses are tested in an early validation step with industry experts in order to support the design of experiments and surveys for further research.","","978-1-6654-1978-9","10.1109/E-TEMS51171.2021.9524860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524860","agile methods;automotive software development;customer collaboration;requirements;iterative development","Industries;Technological innovation;Bibliographies;Europe;Software;Automobiles;Research and development management","automobile industry;automobiles;design of experiments;innovation management;software development management;software prototyping;systems engineering","automotive software development;software-defined products;automotive software developers;complex systems engineering approach;automotive industry;agile development methodology;automotive development;potential lever analysis;digital network business;car classical development process;V-model;customer integration;design of experiments;innovation cycles","","","","21","","1 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But, how to deal with customers' satisfaction and find a better visualization model at the requirements level (which stakeholders can understand and be involved) in an agile development context? Also, how this visualization model enhancement can guarantee consistency between agile requirements artefacts (e.g., user stories and domain models)? Thus, to answer these questions, this paper presents the SnapMind framework. This framework aims to make the requirements modelling process more user-centered, through the definition of a visual requirements language, based on mind maps, model-driven and domain specific language techniques. Moreover, through these techniques, the SnapMind framework focuses on support for consistency between user stories and the domain models using a model animation technique called snapshots. The framework was applied to an industrial case study to investigate its feasibility.","","978-1-4799-6343-0","10.1109/MoDRE.2014.6890825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890825","Agile Software Requirements;Model-Driven Engineering;Domain-Specific Languages;Mind Map;Snapshots","Visualization;Software;Syntactics;Unified modeling language;Adaptation models;Business;Semantics","customer satisfaction;software prototyping","model-based requirements;agile methods;customer satisfaction;rapid delivery;useful software;communication process;agile development context;visualization model enhancement;SnapMind framework;domain specific language techniques;user stories;domain models;model animation technique;snapshots","","11","","48","","8 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The interest has gained even more popularity for those implementing Extreme Programming (XP) which is a well-known Agile methodology. There is a general agreement that pair programming works well with a pair of developers working side by side. However, that is not always possible. Distributed teams and distributed team members are becoming the norm. With that said, is distributed pair programming possible? And if so, can it be done effectively? This paper examines a project where distributed pair programming was extremely effective.

The causes of such failures are many, but are not always easily recognized. This is not the least due to the human dimension of corporate activities, as spurious or misdiagnosed issues in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) projects can take on a life of their own and become a magnet for company politics. This paper reports an industrial case in which the senior management attempted to deal with a troubled ERP implementation (SAP R/3) in an international fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company during 2001 and 2002. This paper reflects this dimension as it uses original emails and PowerPoint slides to recount a number of representative episodes in a troubled but ultimately successful project. At the heart of this success is the realization that whereas it can be difficult and time-consuming to do root-cause analyses, it is relatively simple to identify problem owners. In this case, the senior management without IT backgrounds turned around a failing project by reorganizing the team structure according to process areas so that issues in each process area had one problem owner. We summarize the management's actions into a troubleshooting framework, and in addition, suggest three actions for rescuing troubled projects: keep the project manager but narrow down the manager's scope of responsibility to one or two process areas; assign the right people to be responsible for other process areas; and have the General Manager chair the ERP meetings.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2007.912933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4439890","IT project failures;risk management;software project management;team management","Software;Companies;Schedules;Book reviews;Risk management;Business;Information systems","consumer products;DP industry;enterprise resource planning;project management;software development management","rescuing troubled software projects;team transformation;ERP project;enterprise resource planning projects;fast moving consumer goods company","","28","","47","","22 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In 2013, the Italian Army General Staff Logistic Department decided to overcome the problem of the “volatile requirement” transitioning to a completely different software development methodology derived from the commercial, area but almost completely new to the “mission critical” software applications: the so called “agile” methodology. The introduction of “agile” in the development of high reliability software was not easy and implied the generation of a brand new “agile” methodology called: Italian Army Agile or ITA2. Setting up the LC2Evo (the evolution software of the land C2) implied the solution of many problems and the construction of a solid structure based on four “pillars”: User Community Governance, Specific “agile” Training, new “agile” CASE1 Tools, custom “agile” development doctrine. This paper gives a short description of the Italian C2 software evolution from the current SIACCON2 to the LC2Evo whose first components are in use already in various national and out of area operations. The LC2Evo “dismounted Soldier segment software using augmented reality and goggle glass-like display is also described.

The current paper proposes an improvement in the process of teaching and tracking product development processes classes by implementing a computer-aided task board with real time tracking features. Tickets are defined and created online, then printed and pinned to the physical task board and tracked by a camera.

The more teams, the greater the coordination requirements. Despite the growing popularity of large-scale agile, inter-team coordination is challenging to practice and research. We conducted a case study over 1.5 years in a large-scale software development firm to better understand which inter-team coordination mechanisms are used in large-scale agile and how they support inter-team coordination. Based on a thematic analysis of 31 interviews, 113 hours of observations, and supplemental material, we identified 27 inter-team coordination mechanisms. From this, we offer the following contributions. First, we propose a taxonomy of inter-team coordination with three categories: coordination meetings, such as communities of practice, inter-team stand-ups, and retrospectives; coordination roles, such as the program architects and the platform team; and coordination tools and artefacts, such as Slack and JIRA as well as inter-team task boards, product backlogs, and roadmaps. Second, the coordination mechanisms displayed combinations of four key characteristics, technical, organizational, physical, and social (TOPS), which form the basis of the TOPS framework to capture the multifaceted characteristics of coordination mechanisms. Technical relates to the software product and/or technical tools supporting software development. Organizational pertains to the structural aspects of the organization. Physical refers to tangible or spatial characteristics. Social captures interpersonal and community-based characteristics. Finally, the taxonomy and the TOPS framework provide a knowledge base and a structured approach for researchers to study as well as for software practitioners to understand and improve inter-team coordination in large-scale agile.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3160873","Norges Forskningsrd(grant numbers:267704); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739868","Large-scale agile;agile software development;inter-team coordination;case study;taxonomy","Software;Taxonomy;Task analysis;Agile software development;Teamwork;Protocols;Planning","","","","1","","","CCBY","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

So far, some of the functional requirements remain unknown until late stages of the product development. This is mainly caused by an increasing market dynamic in combination with the continuously changing customer expectations. A way to handle these uncertainties is the highly iterative product development (HIP) approach. By structuring the development project as a highly iterative process, this method provides customer oriented and marketable products. Therefore, it is necessary to structure each development into empiric-adaptive or deterministic-normative scopes. Recently first approaches for the combination of deterministic-normative methods like Stage-Gate and empirical-adaptive methods like SCRUM on a project management basis have emerged. Accordingly, this paper aims at the presentation of a methodology which enables the classification of each development scope by using a HIP-Indicator. This indicator reveals optimum suitability of every development scope for the realization with either empiric-adaptive or deterministic-normative approaches.","2157-362X","978-1-5090-3665-3","10.1109/IEEM.2016.7798062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7798062","agile;highly iterative development;HIP-indicator;product development","Product development;Companies;Manufacturing;Iterative methods;Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Prototypes","agile manufacturing;iterative methods;product development;project management","highly-iterative product development project structuring;HIP-indicators;manufacturing companies;heterogeneous customer requirements;product life cycles;product functions;functional requirements;dynamic market;customer expectations;customer oriented products;marketable products;deterministic-normative method;Stage-Gate;empirical-adaptive method;SCRUM;project management","","5","","30","","29 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study presents a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) that aggregates, summarizes, and discusses the results of 25 relevant primary studies concerning the impact of communication channels and practices in ASD. We followed the well-known systematic mapping methodology in software engineering and analyzed empirical studies published before the end of June 2018. The results of our study have yielded several strategies that can be adopted by practitioners. Communication practices are context dependent. In the case of a distributed team, blended usage of rich-media communication tools, such as shared mind-map tools, videoconferencing, and promoting the exchange of team members between teams, is beneficial. In conclusion, communication can be expensive if teams do not apply the right strategies. Future research direction is to understand how to maximize product quality while reducing communication cost and how to identify the most beneficial communication strategy for the different stages of ASD.","","978-83-949419-5-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8511256","communication practices;communication process;agile software development;scrum;extreme programming","Communication channels;Systematics;Tools;Programming;Face;Data mining;Software engineering","project management;software development management;software prototyping;software quality","ASD practice;communication channels;systematic mapping methodology;software engineering;rich-media communication tools;shared mind-map tools;communication cost;beneficial communication strategy;agile software development;systematic mapping study;SMS;product quality","","","","55","","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developed and described model is based on Scrum, one of the most widespread agile methods. Since Scrum is primarily a framework for managing software projects and software applications development, during the development of the model it was crucial to negotiate the differences between Scrum and the teaching process itself. Teaching model in this paper covers the whole teaching process from first lessons to the final exam. Model consists of three separate units: (1) presentation of theoretical knowledge; (2) practical knowledge and student projects; (3) exams and admission of grades. Each of these units represents a Scrum that results with particular ""products“. Basic characteristics of Scrum like incremental development, iterations, roles and artefacts are implemented in the teaching model using the same principles as in the original Scrum even though their content is adjusted to the specifics of the teaching process. Model is implemented in the Managerial Informatics master study course “Business Application Development” at the Faculty of Economics and Business University of Zagreb.","","978-953-233-077-9","10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859694","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6859694","","Education;Software;Scrum (Software development);Unified modeling language;Business;Computers;Games","educational administrative data processing;project management;software management;software prototyping;teaching","Zagreb;Faculty of Economics and Business University;business application development;managerial informatics master study course;teaching process;software application development;software project management;agile methods;SCRUM;teaching model;agile management","","2","","12","","24 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, very little is explored about the use and suitability of metrics in the context of ASD. We fill this gap by exploring metrics suitable for the ASD process, use of those metrics in practice, perceived benefits, and related tools.

Thus, the creators and consultants of the Agile world may evangelize it with commercial concerns, resulting in ""selling agility"" to organizations as an object in a form of packaged practices (of methods/models/frameworks). As a result, agile mindset may easily lag behind the ""sold"" practices. However, effective agile individuals, teams and organizations require a particular attitude, way of thinking and behavior so called as agile mindset, beyond the given set of procedures, techniques and rituals, which makes it essential and primary before any practice (of any methods or frameworks). Despite its importance, the number of studies aiming to cover the elements of the agile mindset is surprisingly few, which calls for more study on this subject. By considering this gap and as an alternative to the limitations and monopoly of Agile Manifesto in being regarded as the dominant source of the mindset and to ""selling agility"" with a set of practices, this study provides the elements/factors/items of the agile mindset for a proper agility, by reviewing the literature to reach most comprehensive and up-to-date list, along with their categorization, relationships and discussions Thus, this study can serve as a basis to identify in what ways a particular entity (team, organization, or method) differs from the mindset.","","978-1-7281-8541-5","10.1109/UYMS50627.2020.9247073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247073","agile mindset;agility;agile methods;agile frameworks;principles","Bibliographies;Agile software development;Organizations;Monopoly;Software engineering","organisational aspects;project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","agile mindset elements;agile manifesto;literature review;agile software development movement;agility understanding","","1","","27","","9 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various agents of the estimation system access the existing knowledge base and autonomously perform their inferencing activities using description logic as per requirements specified by the scrum master and respond with suitable estimate to him/her in the form of time, resources, and lessons learnt for the success of future projects. To validate our approach, an experiment, based on twelve web projects, was conducted using proposed approach, delphi and planning poker estimation methods.

It identifies deviations in budget and schedule, aids project managers in taking earlier corrective actions against cost and schedule overruns. Although the literature highlights the significance of scope by adopting it as a leading indicator to measure project success or failure. However, EVM does not include scope when evaluating the performance of any software project. While considering the importance of scope and its ever-changing nature, it is imperative to measure the effect of changes in scope on the project plan. To analyse such effects, this study aims to enhance the traditional EVM by incorporating scope into it. The main objectives of this paper are: i) to extract the effects of project scope changes, ii) to map extracted effects of project scope changes with Software Project Scope Rating Index (SPSRI) elements, and iii) to quantify the extracted effects and integrate them with EVM. An extensive literature review is conducted to achieve the first objective, which results in the seventeen unique effects; that were used to map with SPSRI elements. To forecast the variations in scope for a given project budget, Monte Carlo simulations were run on the top eight scope elements, whereas, the results were incorporated with EVM to identify the deviations between actual and projected values of scope's score and cost. Finally, the multivariate regression model was used to evaluate the influence of individual element on the overall estimated cost of the project. The correlation between the independent variables (SPSRI elements) and the dependent variable (overall cost) was calculated along with the valuation of each independent variable on the dependent variable. Moreover, the effects are statistically shown that independent variables have influenced the dependent variable. This technique could assist the project managers to forecast deviations in project scope earlier.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018169","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah(grant numbers:D-648-611-1441); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172051","Earned value management;project monitoring and controlling;software project scope rating index;Monte Carlo simulations","Schedules;Monitoring;Software;Indexes;Software measurement;Estimation;Performance analysis","costing;econophysics;Monte Carlo methods;project management;regression analysis","project plan;Earned Value Management;traditional EVM;project scope changes;map extracted effects;actual projected values;SPSRI elements;Software Project Scope Rating Index elements","","1","","94","CCBY","20 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the imposed structure may impair agile practices or test case generation. In this paper, inspired by cooperation with industry partners, we propose CLARET, a notation that allows the creation of use case specifications using natural language to be used as central artifacts for both RE and MBT practices. A tool set supports CLARET specification by checking syntax of use cases structure as well as providing visualization of flows for use case revisions. We also present exploratory studies on the use of CLARET to create RE documents as well as on their use as part of a system testing process based on MBT.

Several recent surveys show that agile methodologies like Scrum, Extreme Programming and, more recently, Kanban have been successfully adopted by many companies to develop their software. However, the same surveys show that only few of the agile practices are used and even fewer are applied consequently and thoroughly. This is to a great extent due to the lack of skilled personnel. Although teaching agile software development has drawn some attention in recent research and has been discussed in several papers, we do not yet seem to be able to “deliver” the appropriately skilled personnel. What is the reason for this, and more importantly, how can we improve the situation? In this paper we propose a more holistic approach for teaching agile software development, in which the required agile practices and values are not only integrated theoretically into our courses but also practically applied and repeated until they become a habit to our graduates. The proposed concept was realized in a new Software Engineering course held at Zurich University of Applied Sciences during 2012. The evaluation shows very encouraging results, but also leaves some challenges and problems to be solved.","2377-570X","978-1-4673-5140-9","10.1109/CSEET.2013.6595249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595249","","Software;Documentation;Programming;Companies;Educational institutions;Software engineering","computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;kanban;software prototyping;teaching","agile software development teaching;university level;agile methodology;Scrum;extreme programming;Kanban;skilled personnel;software engineering course;Zurich University of Applied Sciences","","47","","23","","12 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a new approach to deal with the dynamic nature of requirements prioritization process in agile development. Training a self-organizing map according to requirement's predefined features is the main process in the proposed approach. The trained map can produce a set of clusters.

This paper seeks to optimize transition operations by developing a methodology to identify and classify different types of transitions from continuous production data. Traditional data analysis methods perform poorly on multi-state temporal signals, so, a new method based on principal component analysis is proposed for transition classification. By analyzing previous plant operating data, different instances of a transition can be identified. Good operating strategies are then extracted by comparing the instances. A self-organizing map based method is also proposed for visualization of process transitions. We illustrate the proposed transitions classification and performance analysis methods by application to a refinery hydro-cracker.","","1-4244-0725-7","10.1109/ICIT.2006.372576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4237898","state-identification;classification;transition performance analysis","Performance analysis;Manufacturing industries;Switches;Agile manufacturing;Optimization methods;Continuous production;Data analysis;Principal component analysis;Data mining;Data visualization","agile manufacturing;chemical engineering;data analysis;distillation equipment;fuel processing industries;oil refining;principal component analysis;process planning;self-organising feature maps","transition classification;performance analysis;industrial hydrocracker;process industries;agile manufacturing;mode switching;process transition;data analysis;multistate temporal signals;principal component analysis;self-organizing map;refinery hydrocracker","","","","11","","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous research reported that the Agile Methodology fosters trust between the development team and the product owner and subsequently the trust improves communications about requirements and expectations with the product owner, and promotes collaborations within the development team. This helped our understanding of the role of trust in Agile methodology; however, it failed to answer the question of why trust is so important in Agile methodology while it has not been so in traditional software development methods. In this paper we use a social complexity approach to investigate the software development process. By looking at software development as a complex endeavor, and using tools and techniques from the Cynefin framework and other models of social complexity, we demonstrate that the increased level of complexity of the software has led to an increase in the level of complexity of the software development process. It transforms the software development process from a simple and complicated process to a complex one. Trust, which functions to resolve complexity, becomes an important factor in such a software development environment. The Agile methodology, which fosters a higher level of trust in the development process, is able to manage the complexity more effectively than traditional software development methods in a complex software development environment, and hence is a favored option in such an environment.","2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078-1","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957686","","Software;Robots;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Context;Radar;Collaboration","computational complexity;software development management;software prototyping;trusted computing","social complexity approach;agile methodology trust;software development teams;product owner;product owner;development team;software development methods;software development process;Cynefin framework","","1","","14","","20 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These dismal statistics have defied years of project management research and all manner of innovative ideas ranging from the early introduction of critical path methods, to the more recent critical chain methodologies, agile software development ideas and much behavioral research on project leadership and teams. Moreover, to manage expertise and share scarce resources the majority of projects today are executed in matrixed organizations with their attendant problems of confused lines of responsibility and complex relationships between the project managers responsible for the timely completion of projects and functional managers responsible for the management of resources. In this paper, we outline a three-pronged attack on these problems. Our main supposition is that projects with different size, complexity and economic or strategic importance should be managed differently. Important large projects should be assigned dedicated resources and managed as projects using accepted project management techniques. Medium-sized projects should be managed in matrixed organizations, while small repetitive projects should not be managed as projects at all. Rather they should be managed using techniques borrowed from production and process management. The paper develops the conceptual underpinnings for these ideas and describes how projects in the latter two categories can be best organized and managed. Our ""divide and conquer"" approach should help management deal with the need for a faster and more sure-footed response to the pressures for change in the face of global competition and ever changing technology.","","978-1-890843-36-6","10.23919/PICMET.2017.8125352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8125352","","Organizations;Project management;Uncertainty;Scheduling","divide and conquer methods;project management;software prototyping;team working","production management concepts;project management research;innovative ideas;critical path methods;agile software development ideas;behavioral research;project leadership;matrixed organizations;accepted project management techniques;medium-sized projects;repetitive projects;process management;critical chain methodologies;divide and conquer approach","","1","","28","","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For software engineering instructors trying to teach such TPs to student teams, manually auditing teams if teams are following the TPs and improving over time is tedious, time-consuming and error-prone. It is even more difficult when those TPs involve two or more tools. For example, starting work on a feature in a project-management tool such as Pivotal Tracker should usually be followed relatively quickly by the creation of a feature branch on GitHub. Merging a feature branch on GitHub should usually be followed relatively quickly by deploying the new feature to a staging server for customer feedback. Few systems are designed specifically to audit such TPs, and existing ones, as far as we know, are limited to a single specific tool. We present Bluejay, an open-source extensible platform that uses the APIs of multiple tools to collect raw data, synthesize it into TP measurements, and present dashboards to audit the TPs. A key insight in Bluejay's design is that TPs can be expressed in terminology similar to that used for modeling and auditing Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance. Bluejay therefore builds on mature tools used in that ecosystem and adapts them for describing, auditing, and reporting on TPs. Bluejay currently consumes data from five different widely-used development tools, and can be customized by connecting it to any service with a REST API.

In certain environments, the demand for the security becomes the main driver of the development. In these cases, the development of the product requires special security arrangements for development and hosting, and specific security-oriented processes for governance. Compliance with these requirements using agile development methods may not only be a chance to improve the project efficiency, but can in some cases, such as in the case discussed in this paper, be an organizational requirement. This paper describes a case of building a secure identity management system and its management processes, in compliance with the Finnish government's VAHTI security instructions. The building project was to be implemented in accordance to the governmental security instructions, while following the service provider's own management framework. Project itself was managed with Scrum. The project's steering group required the use of Scrum, and this project may be viewed as a showcase of Scrum's suitability to multi-teamed, multi-site, security standard-compliant work. We also discuss the difficulties of fulfilling strict security regulations regarding both the development process and the end product in this project, and the difficulties utilizing Scrum to manage a multi-site project organization. Evaluation of the effects of the security work to project cost and efficiency is also presented. Finally, suggestions to enhance the Scrum method for security-related projects are made.","","978-1-5090-0990-9","10.1109/ARES.2016.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7784619","security;Scrum;VAHTI;infrastructure","Security;Government;Buildings;Software;Standards;Documentation","costing;government data processing;organisational aspects;product development;project management;security of data;software development management;software prototyping","security development;agile environment;identity management;government agency;software development projects;computing tasks;security concerns;product development;security-oriented processes;project efficiency;Finnish government VAHTI security instructions;governmental security instructions;Scrum;multiteamed work;multisite work;security standard-compliant work;multisite project organization;project cost;security-related projects","","7","","18","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Discount usability methods are lightweight methods to be integrated with agile methods. The paper addresses research questions, what contextual factors in Ethiopia trigger tailoring usability practices, and how can discount usability methods be adapted and integrated into the Scrum-agile development with especial emphasis on the Ethiopian context. The research aims at adapting software engineering and ICT development methods to the specific situation and integrating user-centered design (UCD) and lightweight usability methods into agile development. Two projects have been considered for the empirical research. Cooperative Method Development (CMD) has been used as the research approach. Interview notes, observations and workshop results have been analyzed using thematic coding and qualitative data analysis. Local IT personnel bridged between end users and developers. Culturally adapted user pair testing and heuristic evaluation supported usability testing and supported developers in getting early feedback.

The Web development industry worldwide is dominated by a myriad of small firms. This presents a challenge in terms of determining the current practices of industry participants, and in devising improvement initiatives which are feasible for small firms. The objectives of this research is to propose a software process model framework that assists the small firms in designing Web based-applications so as not to run over budget and time. To achieve these objectives, an extensive literature survey of Web development methodologies and software process improvement in small firms were conducted to identify Web engineering practice in Web development. The literature survey clarified that, there were several development methodologies of Web-based application. These studies have not taken into consideration software process improvements. A software process framework for Internet development in small firms is proposed in this research .This framework contains several steps to follow; the first step is to begin with small Web project. The second steps is adopt the modified XP process model which is also a suggested process model for Internet development in small firms, and then apply XXPM as a quality model for software process improvement. If the proposed software process framework is to be successful then it must be laid on Web engineering practices.","","978-0-7695-3302-5","10.1109/SERA.2008.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4609418","Agile methods;extreme programming;web applications;software process;small firms","Software;Programming;Project management;Companies;Object oriented modeling;Organizations;Adaptation model","Internet;software development management;software process improvement;software quality;Web design","agile process framework;Web application development;software firm;process quality;Web development industry;software process model;software process improvement;Web engineering;Web project;XP process model;Internet development;software quality;XXPM","","10","","25","","29 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we investigate the concrete reasons for scaling agility beyond teams, the strategies that support such scaling, and the foreseeable implications that such a drastic organizational change will entail. The investigation is based on a qualitative case study, with data from 20 semistructured interviews with managers and technical experts at two automotive companies. At the core of our findings are observations about establishing an agile vehicle-level feedback loop beyond individual teams. First, we find that automotive original equipment manufacturers aim to decrease the lead time of development. Second, we also identify seven strategies that aim to enable scaled-agile beyond teams. Finally, we extract six foreseeable implications and side effects of scaling agile beyond teams in automotive.

Using this approach, the performance requirements and test cases can be specified incrementally, without big upfront analysis. We also provide a post hoc examination of a development effort at IBM that had a high focus on performance requirements. The examination indicates that our evolutionary model can be used to specify performance requirements such that the level of detail is commensurate with the nature of the project. Additionally, the IBM experience indicates that test driven development-type validation testing corresponding to the model can be used to determine if performance objectives have been met.","","0-7695-2562-8","10.1109/AGILE.2006.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667562","","Testing;Software performance;Software systems;Performance analysis;Trademarks;Computer science;System performance;Web server;Guidelines;Time factors","program testing;formal specification;program verification;software performance evaluation;software prototyping","agile performance requirement specification;agile performance requirement testing;software system;evolutionary model;validation testing;agile development methods","","10","","21","","14 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are a number of commercial software tools available to customise and manage PRINCE2 projects on the market. However, most of these are very expensive with a significant learning curve, and generally are not affordable for a small-scale project development or training purposes. Therefore, this paper addresses this problem and proposes a web-based method for managing PRINCE2 projects using Trello. Trello is a web-based project management tool, which is inexpensive and easy to use at a small-scale, where tasks and personnel can be brought together to manage the project in an efficient way. Nevertheless, it is not a particular PRINCE2 project management tool but it can be customised to manage PRINCE2 projects and its stages with basic functionality.","2687-8828","978-1-7281-1783-6","10.1109/ISSE46696.2019.8984516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8984516","","","groupware;Internet;planning;project management;software tools","web-based project management tool;project management methodology;small-scale project development;web-based method;PRINCE2 project management;Trello;collaborative working tool","","2","","12","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This often results in team members over emphasizing their understanding of the goals, without proper incorporation of goals from other stakeholders or customers. Existing UML or other goal oriented modeling methods tend to be overly complex for non-technical stakeholders to properly express their goals and communicate them to the agile team. In this paper, we propose a light weight Goal Net based method to model goal requirements in agile software development process to address this problem. It can be used to decompose complex processes into phased goals, and model low level user stories to high level hierarchy goal structures. Our preliminary analysis and studies in educational software engineering contexts show that it can improve agile team's group awareness to project goals and, thus, improve team productivity and artifact quality. The proposed approach was evaluated in university level agile software engineering projects. It has achieved an improvement of over 50 percentage points in terms of the proportion of high quality user stories generated by students compared to the standard user story template used in Scrum,","","978-1-4799-5604-3","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888731","Agile Software Development;Goal Net;Software Engineering","Mobile handsets;Software;Unified modeling language;Variable speed drives;Educational institutions;Software engineering;Mobile communication","computer science education;software prototyping","agile software development;software requirements;goal oriented modeling method;light weight Goal Net based method;educational software engineering contexts","","18","","23","","1 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results were limited to peer-reviewed conference papers/journal articles, published between 1999 and 2009. The synthesis was made through classifying the papers into different categories (e.g. research type, distribution). The analysis revealed that in most cases agile practices were modified with respect to the context and situational requirements.

As in software engineering, there are methodologies guiding the business process elicitation activity. Accordingly, there have been also works proposing agile and lightweight methodologies for carrying out this activity. In this paper we present a tool which was especially developed for supporting an agile business process elicitation. It is based on requirements which can be derived from the description of the agile methodologies described in the literature. Two important characteristics of this tool are mobility and collaboration.

In order to ensure BlackParrot is easy to use, extend, and, most importantly, trust, development is guided by three core principles: Be Tiny, Be Modular, and Be Friendly. Development efforts have prioritized the use of intentional interfaces and modularity and silicon validation as first-order design metrics, so that users can quickly get started and trust that their design will perform as expected when deployed. BlackParrot has been validated in a GlobalFoundries 12-nm FinFET tapeout.

The challenge in providing this when teaching undergraduate engineers is the dichotomy between achieving realism and maintaining sufficient simplicity to make the course tractable. A real-world group technology project at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) in New Zealand establishes essential non-technical attributes required by the engineering profession while covering key elements of the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK). This paper first shows how the project covers the knowledge required in project management and then presents the results of two years of data collected from students' reflection on their own learning. We have established a pleasing congruence across the years against the specific learning topics of team working skills, communication skills and personal working skills with an improvement in project management skills. A key finding emerging from our analysis is the importance of reinforcement learning and reflective learning. We show a key link between these two learning mechanisms and the project pedagogy. Further analysis shows the link between the project pedagogy and four skill areas acquired. Finally, our research has identified specific areas for us to focus on for subsequent years.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344301","project management;real-world project;graduate attributes","Project management;Education;Software engineering;Software;Monitoring;Cultural differences","educational courses;engineering education;further education;learning (artificial intelligence);project management;team working","teaching project management;real-world group project;effective pedagogy;undergraduate engineers teaching;dichotomy;educational course;Victoria University of Wellington;VUW;New Zealand;project management body of knowledge;PMBOK;team working skills;communication skills;personal working skills;reinforcement learning;reflective learning","","7","","26","","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In other cases, the ERP systems are unable to provide solution which is a simplicity of the necessary business processes. The ERP implementation complexity is one of the factors that lead the failures. Thus, here, we intend to propose an agile approach to reduce complexity and eventually our intention is to improve ERP implementing to become more successful.

Following Agile principles of software development is a natural choice. However, to truly leverage the power of Agile, big organizations need to be able to utilize distributed teams effectively. Agile relies hugely on shared context and awareness among team members and this can become a stumbling block among such geographically dispersed teams. Moreover, in such large projects there is a need for incentivizing quick delivery of user stories so that the teams have a constructive sense of competition and are recognized in-process. Here, we describe a gamification based approach which promotes quicker completion and acceptance of user stories in such distributed Agile projects. Our approach captures important events from the development environment and then helps create project-wide awareness regarding the progress of different teams. A model of earning revenue for faster delivery of user stories is used to determine the leading team at the end of each sprint. This approach has been implemented in an Agile process guidance and awareness workbench that we are piloting within our organization.","","978-1-4503-4160-8","10.1145/2896958.2896966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809516","Distributed Agile;Agile Gamification;Software Delivery","Software;Games;Planning;Organizations;Context;Data mining","software prototyping;team working","gamification;distributed agile delivery;business requirements;agile principles;software development;distributed teams;gamification based approach;agile process guidance;agile process awareness","","","","14","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is because both agile development and UI design are iterative - but while agile methods iterate on code with iterations lasting weeks, UI designs typically iterate only on the user interface using low technology prototypes with iterations lasting hours or days. Similarly, both agile development and UI design emphasise testing, but agile development involves automated code testing, while UI must done by expert inspectors or ideally potential end users. We report on a qualitative grounded theory study of real agile projects involving significant UI design. The key results from our study are that agile iterations facilitates usability testing; allows software developers to incorporate results of those tests into subsequent iterations; and crucially, can significantly improve the quality of the relationship between UI designers and software developers.","","0-7695-2872-4","10.1109/AGILE.2007.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293575","","Software prototyping;Iterative methods;User interfaces;Software performance;Prototypes;Automatic testing;Software testing;Software quality;Process design;Usability","software engineering;user interfaces","agile development iteration;user interaction design;automated code testing","","60","","8","","27 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some of them result in overall project failure due to incorrect or missing quality characteristics such as security. There are several concerns that make security difficult to deal with; for instance, (1) when stakeholders discuss general requirements in meetings, they are often unaware that they should also discuss security-related topics, and (2) they typically do not have enough expertise in security. This often leads to unspecified or ill-defined security-related aspects. These concerns become even more challenging in agile contexts, where lightweight documentation is typically involved. The goal of this paper is to design and evaluate an approach for reviewing security-related aspects in agile requirements specifications of web applications. The approach considers user stories and security specifications as input and relates those user stories to security properties via Natural Language Processing. Based on the related security properties, our approach then identifies high-level security requirements from the Open Web Application Security Project to be verified and generates a reading technique to support reviewers in detecting defects. We evaluate our approach via two controlled experiment trials. We compare the effectiveness and efficiency of novice inspectors verifying security aspects in agile requirements using our approach against using the complete list of high-level security requirements. The (statistically significant) results indicate that using our approach has a positive impact (with large effect size) on the performance of inspectors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.","2332-6441","978-1-7281-3912-8","10.1109/RE.2019.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920644","agile requirements;requirements verification;software inspection;software security","Software;Stakeholders;Inspection;Software engineering;Documentation;Application security","formal specification;Internet;security of data;software quality","web applications;security specifications;related security properties;high-level security requirements;Open Web Application Security Project;novice inspectors verifying security aspects;security-related aspects;agile requirements specifications;general requirements;security-related topics","","3","","39","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prominent agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), help quickly deliver a system that meets Functional Requirements (FRs), while adapting to the changes in the customer requirements and feedback. However, Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) by and large have been either mostly ignored or introduced and retrofit late in the software development cycle, oftentimes leading to project failures. With the recent, increasing shifts towards cloud and emphasis in big data in the software industry, NFRs, such as security and performance, have become more critical than ever before. This research proposes a novel approach to handling security and performance NFRs for projects involving big data and cloud, using Scrum. An industrial case study, conducted over a span of 9 months, shows that the approach helps deal with security and performance requirements individually as well as conflicts between them in an agile methodology.","","978-1-5090-3519-9","10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2017.7943152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943152","Big Data;Internet of Things (IoT);Agile Methodologies;NFRs;Scrum","Security;Cloud computing;Big Data;Industries;US Department of Defense","Big Data;Internet of Things;software houses;software maintenance;software prototyping","nonfunctional requirements handling;Big Data;IOT projects;Scrum;agile methodologies;software industry;extreme programming;XP;functional requirements;NFR;software retrofitting;software development cycle","","18","","19","","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For developing a perfect system we also need a perfect framework or architecture. The proposed framework is just not a framework, but it provides us a complete pattern and flows to develop a software system. It includes initial steps from requirements gathering till its final steps like implementation and testing. This research is based on such a multidimensional framework for software development which covers six dimensions that are used implicitly or explicitly. There are four viewpoints that represent different stakeholders. These dimensions and viewpoints are integrated with the scrum process to increase the quality of software systems.

The proposed optimal path planning algorithm was based on a quintic polynomial with three path segments in order to decrease angular velocity in the attitude maneuver process as far as possible to improve system stability under the condition of satisfying CubeSat's limited control capability, and there is also an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm for the optimization of path planning, in which the variation and crossover coefficients all obey the beta distribution. The finite-time controller was based on the nonsingular terminal sliding mode, and an improved PD-type sigmoid function was proposed to replace the sign function. Finally, the physical simulation platform is built by using the NJUST-2 as an object, and the results revealed that the finite-time controller based on the Beta DE path planning can decrease angular velocity in the attitude maneuver process as far as possible to improve system stability under the condition of satisfying the CubeSat's limited control capability and then achieves a stable attitude large-angle maneuver just by using momentum wheels and a magnetorquer.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927401","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61803204); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20180465); Civilian Space Project for China’s 13th Five-Year Plan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756274","CubeSat;attitude maneuver;path planning;quintic polynomial;differential evolution;finite-time control","CubeSat;Attitude control;Wheels;Angular velocity;Mathematical model;Torque;Path planning","angular velocity control;artificial satellites;attitude control;evolutionary computation;optimal control;path planning;PD control;polynomials;stability;statistical distributions;torque control;variable structure systems","attitude maneuver process;system stability;stable attitude large-angle maneuver;momentum wheels;optimal path planning-based finite-time control;agile CubeSat attitude maneuver;finite-time controller;optimal path planning algorithm;path segments;angular velocity;limited control capability;PD-type sigmoid function;magnetorquer;quintic polynomial;differential evolution algorithm;crossover coefficients;beta distribution;nonsingular terminal sliding mode;NJUST-2;beta DE path planning","","6","","35","CCBY","8 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Myriad OPMS options are available for scrutiny and eventual selection by E-commerce project managers. This paper is premised on the need to compare some of these options and come up with the tool mostly ideal for an e-commerce project.

While prior studies have identified various antecedents of turnover with the general objective of reducing its occurrence, turnover cannot be completely prevented in practice. This study examines practices for mitigating the negative impact of turnover when it occurs. Since ISD is knowledge intensive and turnover typically involves knowledge degradation, this study focuses on key practices for reducing such knowledge degradation, i.e., job enlargement, use of electronic knowledge repositories, and succession planning. Our model for explaining the effects of the practices, based on the human capital and organizational forgetting theories, is tested through a survey of 138 project managers of ISD teams experiencing turnover. The results indicate that the use of electronic knowledge repositories and succession planning reduce the negative effect of turnover on the project performance. In contrast, job enlargement does not have a significant mitigating effect. This study contributes to research by looking beyond the antecedents and prevention of turnover to understand how it can be managed effectively. The findings also offer pragmatic suggestions for alleviating the detrimental effects of team member turnover on the ISD project performance.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2014.2332339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6858000","Human capital;information systems development (ISD);knowledge degradation;member turnover;organizational forgetting;project performance;Human capital;information systems development (ISD);knowledge degradation;member turnover;organizational forgetting;project performance","Planning;Degradation;Information systems;Productivity;Organizations;Knowledge engineering","information systems;knowledge management;organisational aspects;project management;strategic planning","information systems development project performance;team member turnover;knowledge intensive ISD;knowledge degradation;job enlargement;electronic knowledge repositories;human capital;organizational forgetting theories;project managers;ISD teams;succession planning;negative turnover effect;ISD project performance","","15","","91","IEEE","17 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

What are necessary and prudent efforts when a customer calls with a major security problem that needs to be fixed with a proven, off-the-approval-list, multi-layered integrated system with high visibility and limited funding and expires at the end of the Fiscal Year? Whether driven by budget cycles, safety, or by management decree, many such projects begin with generic scopes and funding allocated based on a rapid management ""guestimate."" Then a Project Manager (PM) is assigned a project with a predefined and potentially limited scope, compressed schedule, and potentially insufficient funding. The PM is tasked to rapidly and cost effectively coordinate a requirements-based design, implementation, test, and turnover of a fully operational system to the customer, all while the customer is operating and maintaining an existing security system. Many project management manuals call this an impossible project that should not be attempted. However, security is serious business and the reality is that rapid deployment of proven systems via an ""Extreme Project"" is sometimes necessary. Extreme Projects can be wildly successful but require a dedicated team of security professionals lead by an experienced project manager using a highly-tailored and agile project management process with management support at all levels, all combined with significant interface with the customer. This paper does not advocate such projects or condone eliminating the valuable analysis and project management techniques. Indeed, having worked on a well-planned project provides the basis for experienced team members to complete Extreme Projects. This paper does, however, provide insight into what it takes for projects to be successfully implemented and accepted when completed under extreme conditions.","2153-0742","978-1-4244-7402-8","10.1109/CCST.2010.5678718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678718","Extreme Project;Project Management;security system implementation;resources;agile project","Security;Schedules;Personnel;Lead;Procurement;Project management;Documentation","decision trees;project management;security of data;software management;software prototyping","decision trees;software code;risk management;security system;multilayered integrated system;project management","","","","6","","30 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While Scrum plays an important role in the success of Agile development, it does come with its own challenges. In previous research challenges have been analyzed at the organizational and team level, primarily via case studies. However, fundamentally, Scrum needs to be adopted at the individual level. Furthermore, challenges such as inexperience, poor communication' specialization, lack of teamwork, low-quality, organizational culture and Scrum compatibility, have been identified as contributors. This paper therefore discusses the Scrum and Agile adoption challenges faced both globally as well as within the South African borders, from the findings of a narrative review. Secondly, a custom model adapted from the Diffusion of Innovation theoretical model was developed to detect the Scrum adoption challenges experienced within software organizations at the individual level. The custom model referred to as the Scrum Adoption Challenges Detection Model (SACDM) consists of four constructs, namely; individual factors, team factors, organizational factors and technology factors. The constructs are composed of nineteen independent variables that assists in understanding which factors contributes towards an individual either adopting or rejecting Scrum within a software organization. SACDM is therefore used to detect the adoption or rejection of Scrum as the dependent variable based on the independent variables being tested within the four constructs. The model can further be used with a survey questionnaire to provide generalized awareness of Scrum adoption challenges allowing software organizations to make more informed decisions when adopting Scrum, Future research is to allow the model to contribute towards Scrum adoption challenges predictive analysis.","","978-83-949419-5-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8511227","Adoption Challenges;Agile Methodologies;Scrum;Software Engineering;Software Organization","Software;Scrum (Software development);Organizations;Adaptation models;Technological innovation;Software engineering","organisational aspects;project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","serum adoption challenges;Scrum compatibility;software organization;scrum adoption challenges detection model;agile adoption challenges;agile methodology;SACDM","","","","52","","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, very few studies focus on factors that could ensure long-term use of metrics, and even fewer studies investigate such factors in the context of Agile Software Development (ASD). Motivated by this knowledge gap, we aim to identify success factors for operationalizing metrics in ASD, particularly, factors that could help in the long-term use of metrics. We conducted a multiple case study, where we operationalized process metrics at two software-intensive companies using ASD. We learned that data availability and development process are the two fundamental success factors for process metrics operationalization, albeit less prominent in literature. Companies prefer iterative and incremental operationalization of stable and functional process metrics, which is analogous to the agile way of working. Metrics trustworthiness plays a key role in successful operationalization of process metrics, and is potentially vital to ensuring their long-term use. By comparing the identified success factors with the existing literature, we conclude that success factors concerning data availability, development process, and metrics trustworthiness warrant greater attention, especially to maximize the chances of long-term use of process metrics.","","978-1-7281-3393-5","10.1109/ICSSP.2019.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812843","process metrics;trustworthiness;agile;GQM","Measurement;Companies;Software;Collaboration;Tools;Team working;Interviews","formal specification;project management;security of data;software development management;software metrics;software prototyping","fundamental success factors;iterative operationalization;incremental operationalization;stable process metrics;functional process metrics;ASD;software-intensive companies;agile software development;process metrics operationalization;metrics trustworthiness","","9","","29","","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach poses the problem of grading and evaluating practical project work as well as process conformance during development. Yet, few best practices exist for measuring the success of students in implementing agile practices. Most university courses rely on observations during the course or final oral exams. In this paper, we propose a set of metrics which give insights into the adherence to agile practices in teams. The metrics identify instances in development data, e.g. commits or user stories, where agile processes were not followed. The identified violations can serve as starting points for further investigation and team discussions. With contextual knowledge of the violation, the executed process or the metric itself can be refined. The metrics reflect our experiences with running a software engineering course over the last five years. They measure aspects which students frequently have issues with and that diminish process adoption and student engagement. We present the proposed metrics, which were tested in the latest course installment, alongside tutoring, lectures, and oral exams.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757684","Metrics;Computer engineering;Assessment tools;Capstone projects;Higher education","Measurement;Context;Software;Education;Complexity theory;Software engineering;Best practices","computer science education;educational courses;software metrics;software prototyping;teaching","agile metrics;university software engineering course;agile software development teaching;university courses;oral exams","","13","","19","","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a process to assist architects in Making decisions about Flexibility investment in Software Architecture (MAKE Flexi). MAKE Flexi is based on technical debt and real options approaches. Technical debt allows for estimating the additional cost derived from the lack of flexibility in software architectures, whereas the real options valuation allows for estimating the value of the flexibility that a design option could provide.

In the market today, several tools are available for monitoring the progress of a project. However, most of these tools lack sufficient progress monitoring mechanisms, making them unattractive for many organizations. Moreover, some of the tools do not report and/or visualize useful information regarding the project status. To address these limitations, this study investigates some of the common tools used by Software Development Organizations (SDOs), which leverage on project management approaches and the concept of Agile methods. The SPM tools' pros and cons were identified through a literature survey. The key limitations were highlighted to show the gap in this area that led to the inception of this study. Resultantly, a Progress Monitoring Prototype Tool (PM-PT) was developed to overcome the limitations of the existing tools used in SPM. Subsequently, PM-PT was tested and evaluated by interviewing seven software practitioners. The initial results indicate that PM-PT is a useful and effective tool for software project monitoring task. Future work will focus on improving PM-PT based on the constructive suggestions and recommendations provided by the software practitioners.","","978-1-7281-4487-0","10.1109/ICOICE48418.2019.9035146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9035146","software project management;Agile methods;Kanban method;progress monitoring;PM-PT","Tools;Monitoring;Software;Task analysis;Prototypes;Project management;Visualization","organisational aspects;project management;software development management","software project monitoring task;software project management;software development organizations;SPM tools;progress monitoring prototype tool","","1","","36","","16 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To apply FSM accurately at the early stages of software development process, especially for estimation purposes, functional user requirements need to be available in detail as required by the adopted FSM method. However, in agile software development, requirement specifications, in general, are kept minimal. For this reason, the adjustment of the requirements to the necessary granularity level has been articulated as one of the barriers preventing the diffusion of FSM practices among agile teams. In this paper, we take a closer look at this problem in order to investigate the usability of FSM and to reveal FSM related challenges empirically through case studies on real agile projects from different software organizations. This study also provides a snapshot of agile organizations in terms of requirement specification and estimation related practices.","","978-1-7281-3421-5","10.1109/SEAA.2019.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906756","agile, functional size, COSMIC","Estimation;Size measurement;Organizations;Software;Software measurement;Guidelines","","","","1","","30","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article we explore an approach to project management that focuses on projects as having a technical documentation structure with content that is developed through social or interpersonal communication practices. Looking at the broader picture of project management which, besides the implementation phase, also includes conception, planning and closure, we see a project management framework that brings together both technical and social aspects of project communication. To understand how this works, we interviewed project managers about their understanding and strategy in communicating about the projects they lead. Findings demonstrate that more experienced project managers have a more nuanced understanding of project communication as both technical and social in nature. This correlation of experience to rhetorical understanding based on interpersonal communication invites the question of whether technical communication as a field is actually preparing students not only to participate in projects as technical and professional communicators, but also to have a head start on the path to becoming an effective project manager.","2158-1002","978-1-4799-3375-4","10.1109/IPCC.2015.7235842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7235842","Project management communication;professional communication;socio-technical design;technical communication","Project management;Documentation;Interviews;Context;Companies","professional communication;project management;strategic planning","project management communication 2.0;sociotechnical design;professional communicators;PM;project management communication practices;technical communication;professional communication;technical documentation structure;social communication practices;interpersonal communication practices;implementation phase;project conception;project closure;project planning","","1","","26","","3 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates the factors that support, and deter, pair programming adoption in a case study at a software development company in the eThekwini (Durban) region, South Africa. The survey and interviews indicate that the most positive influences are the support from senior and peer staff and the company's willingness to provide the necessary hardware, software and physical layout to enable the use of pair programming. The biggest challenge was the personality mix in a pair, for example introvert/extrovert pairs, where extroverts can dominate pair collaboration. This company has specific managerial guidelines and practices which are used to mitigate the challenges and provide support to, not only make pair programming a more operationally feasible option, but also reap its benefits.","","978-1-7281-6770-1","10.1109/icABCD49160.2020.9183869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183869","pair programming;XP (extreme programming);software developer","Programming;Software;Companies;Industries;Productivity;Agile software development;Collaboration","DP industry;groupware;programming;project management;software development management;software prototyping;software quality;source code (software)","agile software development company;XP practice;software development departments;pair programming adoption;pair collaboration;high quality code;eThekwini company;Durban region;South Africa","","","","17","","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While that flexibility is consistent with the agile philosophy, it can lead to the adoption of principles and practices that can be sub-optimal relative to the desired objectives. We question then, how can one determine if adopted practices are ""in sync"" with the identified principles, and to what extent those principles support organizational objectives? In this research, we focus on assessing the ""goodness"" of an agile method adopted by an organization based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to provide the supporting environment to successfully implement the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. To guide our assessment, we propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) framework. The design of the OPP framework revolves around the identification of the agile objectives, principles that support the achievement of those objectives, and practices that reflect the ""spirit"" of those principles. Well-defined linkages between the objectives and principles, and between the principles and practices are also established to support the assessment process. We assess the adequacy of an agile method by traversing the linkages in a top-down fashion. That is, given the set of objectives espoused by the agile method, we follow the linkages downward to ensure that the appropriate principles are enunciated, and that the proper practices are expressed. We assess the capability of an organization to implement its adopted method and the effectiveness of that implementation by using both a top-down and bottom-up traversal of the linkages. The bottom-up assessment, however, is predicated on the identification of people, process, project and product properties associated with each practice that attest to the presence and implementation of that practice. We refer to each practice, property pair as an indicator. By following the linkages upward from the indicators, we can infer the use of proper principles and the achievement of desired objectives.","","978-0-7695-4379-6","10.1109/ECBS.2011.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934800","Agile Assessment;Assessing Adequacy;Capability;Effectiveness;Linkages between Objectives;Principles;Practices;Indicators","Organizations;Couplings;Software;Object recognition;Measurement;Programming;Capability maturity model","software prototyping","structured framework;goodness assessment;agile method;organizational objectives;objectives, principles and practices framework;bottom-up assessment","","13","","46","","30 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These issues pose threats to the success of a large-scale software project such as ERP. This research adopts a case study approach to examine how poor project management can imperil the implementation of an ERP system. Having learned the lessons from the failure of its first ERP implementation, the company in this case reengineered its project management practices to successfully carry out its second ERP implementation. Many critical project management factors contributed to the failure and success of this company's ERP system. This study explores and identifies critical elements of project management that contributed to the success of the second ERP implementation.

In this paper we will preview the development methodologies used in building DSS, compare between software development methodologies according to their suitability for building DSS, present the characteristics of DSS development methodology, and propose a new development methodology.","","978-1-4244-4456-4","10.1109/ICADIWT.2009.5273971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5273971","","Decision support systems;Programming;Artificial intelligence;Information systems;Software engineering;Decision making;Knowledge management;Power system management;Application software;Appropriate technology","decision support systems;software prototyping","decision support systems;agile software development methodologies;DSS","","3","","33","","2 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Usability engineering has made its way into the software mainstream and has caught the attention of software engineers and researchers worldwide due to rapidly growing and volatile internet software industry, despite their different perspectives on creating software both have a major role in making good software. Usability focuses on how the end users will work with the software and agile development focuses on how the software should be developed. The way these two perspectives are being combined in practice is still not well understood. This study is a preliminary literature review that describes the key question that how usability-engineering practices should be integrated with agile software development in order to make stronger and effective usable software system. This paper focuses on identifying the tensions between usability and agile methods. The research aim is to identify the common approach of agile methods and usability engineering by surveying extensive related work on integration of usability and agile methods.","","978-1-4244-7164-5","10.1109/ICCDA.2010.5540916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540916","usability;user-centered design;agile development;extreme programming (XP)","Usability;Programming;Design engineering;Educational institutions;User centered design;Testing;Software quality;Internet;Computer industry;Software systems","software prototyping;software reusability","usability engineering;agile software development;software product quality;Internet software industry","","67","","35","","9 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other side, an agile process may affect growth of entropy. We report from a case study of a successful software product line organization that has adopted the agile development method Evo, showing how agility and entropy are negatively related. We conclude this study by suggesting a two-step approach to manage entropy while maintaining process agility.

Agile development methods have generally expected system architecture and interaction design to occur outside the development team, or to occur in very small increments within the team. Because of this, agile practices often prove to be insufficient in addressing issues of solution design, user interaction design, and high-level system architecture. Increasingly, agile development practices are being thought of as good ways to organize software development, but insufficient ways to address design. Because design is fundamentally iterative and development is fundamentally iterative, the two disciplines suffer if they are not carefully integrated with each other. Because lean development lays out a set of principles that demand a whole-product, complete life-cycle, cross-functional approach, it's the more likely candidate to guide the combination of design, development, deployment, and validation into a single feedback loop focused on the discovery and delivery of value.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2012.107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6226341","lean;agile;scrum;Kanban;XP;lean startup;continuous delivery;design thinking;Toyota","Programming;Software development;Product development;Agile manufacturing;Tutorials;Assembly;Design methodology;Product life cycle management","software prototyping","lean software development;agile software development;system architecture;user interaction design;high-level system architecture;whole-product approach;complete life-cycle approach;cross-functional approach","","66","","10","","26 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The Scrum is the widely used method of Agile. Most of the software development organizations are using Scrum these days but these are facing problems related to estimation of cost and effort. It has been observed that the current estimation method in Scrum mostly rely on historical data from past projects and expert opinion but in absence of historical data and experts these methods are not efficient. So there is need of an algorithmic method, which can calculate cost and effort of the software project. In this direction S. Bhalero, Maya Ingel [2] has considered some project-related factors that calculate the cost as well as effort of the project for a general Agile environment. However, several other project as well as people related factors may affect the Scrum environment. In this work an Algorithmic estimation method is being proposed considering various factors thereby estimating the more accurate release date, cost, effort and duration for the project specifically for Scrum. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm has been shown by considering three cases in which different levels of factors are taken and compared.","","978-1-4673-5986-3","10.1109/ICISCON.2013.6524182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6524182","Sprint-point;Scrum;Scrum Estimation;Cost;Effort","Estimation;Software;Complexity theory;Security;Scrum (Software development);Software algorithms;Planning","project management;software cost estimation;software prototyping","sprint-point based estimation technique;agile methodology;software development methodology;software development organizations;cost estimation;historical data;algorithmic method;software project;Agile environment;Scrum environment;algorithmic estimation method","","11","","14","","6 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DevOps is particularly challenging because it covers technical concepts, such as pipeline automation, and non-technical ones, such as team roles and project management. The present study investigates a course setup to introduce these concepts to software engineering undergraduates. We designed the course by employing coding to associate DevOps concepts to Agile, Lean, and Open source practices and tools. We present the main aspects of this project-oriented DevOps course, with 240 students enrolled it since its first offering in 2016. We conducted an empirical study, with both a quantitative and qualitative analysis, to evaluate this project-oriented course setup. We collected the data from the projects repository and students' perceptions from a questionnaire. We mined 148 repositories (corresponding to 72 projects) and obtained 86 valid responses to the questionnaire. We also mapped the concepts which are more challenging to students learn from experience. The results evidence that first-hand experience facilitates the comprehension of DevOps concepts and enriches classes discussions. we present a set of lessons learned, which may help professors better design and conduct project-oriented courses to cover DevOps concepts.","","978-1-6654-0138-8","10.1109/ICSE-SEET52601.2021.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402207","DevOps;education;Open-source;OSS;FOSS;Empirical-software-engineering;Agile-software-development;Emerging-domains-of-software;Tools-and-environments","Training;Industries;Pipelines;Project management;Tools;Software;Software engineering","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;further education;software development management;software prototyping;teaching","project-oriented DevOps course;project-oriented course setup;projects repository;software industry;software engineering teaching;software engineering learning;technical concept;student perceptions;agile practice;lean practice;software engineering undergraduate qualification;open source practice;nontechnical concept","","1","","34","","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, Agile teams often underestimate development effort. Therefore, it seems beneficial to support such teams with the information regarding the functional size of requirements they are estimating. Hussain, Kosseim and Ormandjieva (HKO) proposed a method that can be used to automatically classify textual requirements with respect to their COSMIC functional size. Unfortunately, the method has not been sufficiently validated to confirm its usefulness. Objective: To provide external validation of the HKO method and investigate if it can be applied to classify scenario-based requirements (in the form of use cases) with respect to their COSMIC size. Method: Similarily to the original study, we used a set of natural language processing tools to extract syntactic linguistic features and the C4.5 decision tree-based classifiers to classify requirements. We validated the performance of the classifiers using the 10-fold cross-validation procedure on a dataset containing 93 use cases. We compared the performance of the HKO method with the performance of the classifiers trained using a single prediction feature-the number of steps in a use case. Results: Depending on the considered number of size classes and the algorithm used to compute boundaries of the classes, the accuracy of the HKO method ranged between .387 and .785 while the Cohen's kappa index was between .194 and .577. The accuracy of the use-case-steps-based classifiers performed slightly worse. Their accuracy ranged between .015 and .769 while Cohen's kappa was between .067 and .423. We observed that the performance of both types of classifiers dropped visibly when applied to four or more size classes. Conclusion: The classification performance of the HKO method was moderate. However, it was still better than the classification based on the number of steps. Unfortunately, we also observed that the accuracy of the HKO method is sensitive to the language used in descriptions of requirements.","","978-1-5090-4147-3","10.1109/IWSM-Mensura.2016.039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809611","COSMIC;functional size measurement;agile;replication study","Software;Size measurement;Syntactics;Pragmatics;Software measurement;Estimation;Planning","approximation theory;natural language processing;software prototyping","COSMIC functional size approximation;syntactic linguistic features;replication study;expert judgment;agile software development;Hussain, Kosseim and Ormandjieva;HKO;textual requirements;natural language processing tools;syntactic linguistic feature extraction;Cohen's kappa index","","","","40","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the long and rich history of self-organizing teams and their recent popularity with Agile methods, there has been little research on the topic within software wngineering. Particularly, there is a dearth of research on how Agile teams organize themselves in practice. Through a Grounded Theory research involving 58 Agile practitioners from 23 software organizations in New Zealand and India over a period of four years, we identified informal, implicit, transient, and spontaneous roles that make Agile teams self-organizing. These roles-Mentor, Coordinator, Translator, Champion, Promoter, and Terminator-are focused toward providing initial guidance and encouraging continued adherence to Agile methods, effectively managing customer expectations and coordinating customer collaboration, securing and sustaining senior management support, and identifying and removing team members threatening the self-organizing ability of the team.

Software project managers also need what can be called `project intelligence' tools in order to deal with the continuously changing and complex software project environment which can be likened to a business environment. Based on this requirement, this research paper proposes that software projects be modeled as a business in order to apply a business intelligence model so as to develop `project intelligence' tools for software projects. That is, the aim of this research paper is to propose `project intelligence' tools which are modeled on business intelligence tools. The extension of BI tools to software projects follows from the premise that projects are business constructs through which a business is operated to create a sustainable stakeholder-value. The use of `project intelligence' tools will enable a software project manager to gain a clear knowledge about factors that may affect project progress and such knowledge will enable quick and informed quality decision making processes which will ensure improved sustainable project performance.","2153-0033","978-1-4673-5943-6","10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757849","business intelligence;project intelligence;tools;modeling;business decisions","Bismuth;Project management;Software;Organizations;Decision making;Real-time systems","competitive intelligence;decision making;project management;software engineering","software engineering project modelling;business intelligence perspective;business managers;organization competitiveness;agile decision making;volatile business environments;BI tools;software project managers;project intelligence tools;sustainable stakeholder-value","","1","","35","","6 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ordering the tasks and coordinating the individual actors are prerequisites for the success of a project. The sub-teams (groups) may be distributed in terms of space, time or organization. The groups have to plan their local (intra-group) tasks and coordinate their inter-group tasks while avoiding global deadlocks. Today, centralized approaches with a single diagram for the entire team are used to model the global task order and calculate its critical path. We propose that each group models its intra- and inter-group tasks in a single diagram. Causal nets represent the precedences in an ideal way. Inter-group tasks require a special treatment that we provide by extending causal nets with synchronous channels. These can be executed within the Renew IDE. We consider time aspects based on a mapping between those extended causal nets and Network Planning Technique (NPT). Supported by a Renew plugin we aggregate the separated groups' diagrams to a global NPT diagram to calculate the project's critical path. Beside the tool support for general project management, we present and discuss the support for agile and distributed software development projects. Our extensions preserve the efficient checking for consistent, partially ordered global project plans.","1550-4808","978-1-5386-7013-2","10.1109/ACSD.2018.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8542127","High-level Petri nets;Synchronous Channels;Causal Nets;Project Management;Critical Path Method;Team Coordination","Task analysis;Synchronization;System recovery;Planning;Project management;Uplink;Time factors","graph theory;groupware;project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","inter-group tasks;synchronous channels;extended causal nets;global NPT diagram;general project management;global project plans;team coordination;intra-group tasks;Renew IDE;network planning technique;Renew plugin;distributed software development projects;agile software development projects","","","","30","","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a grounded theory of agile architecture that describes how agile software teams answer the question of how much upfront architecture design effort is enough.

Project retrospectives may support project teams in reflecting on how requirements are agreed upon and communicated throughout a project. However, time is rarely taken for group reflection after project completion. Furthermore, project events may be recalled differently due to memory bias. We propose supporting project retrospective meetings by providing prepared evidence-based timelines visualizing the project history. The method was designed and evaluated in collaboration with a large telecommunications company using action research with the goal of assessing RE within the full development life-cycle. The initial evaluation results show that the method may support project retrospectives through fact-based memory recall and by enabling efficient and factual group discussions of RE in the context of the project life-cycle.

New algorithms acts as guiding light for the persistently needed attention to the softwares. A software should be able to cater the rapidly changing needs & requirements of users. A satisfied user is a manifestation of a good approach & implementation of a much pragmatic way. User's requirements evolve over time with quick changing market needs which needs to be attended dynamically. This led to adopt an approach of agile to be adopted which is based on `lean' principles over the traditional software development life cycle (SDLC) approach. Collaborative work done with the project team leads a well-documented priority list of the needs. The implementation is done through “SCRUM” an empirical framework for learning.

This idea has substantially created a reduction in the `time to market' as the customer can decide which features of the software they would like to be delivered on a priority basis.

To assure the correct function of such software, the development processes are heavily regulated by international standards, often making the process very rigid, unable to accommodate changes, causing late integration and increasing the cost of development. Agile methods have been introduced to address these issues in several software domains, but their use in safety-critical applications remains to be investigated. This paper provides an initial analysis of agile practices in the context of software development for the European railway sector, regulated by the EN 50128 standard. The study complements previous studies on the use of agile methods in other regulated domains. A systematic mapping between EN 50128 requirements and agile practices showed that all practices support some objectives of the standard. Important supporting features recognized were focus on simple design, test automation, coding standards, continuous integration and validation. However, several problematic areas were also identified, including vague requirement analysis and change management. Most agile practices must be adapted to suit regulated software development and this analysis outlines a subset of the required changes.","","978-1-4673-5048-8","10.1109/ISSREW.2012.80","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405469","software engineering;software development processes;agile practices;safety-critical systems;railway;EN 50128","Software;Standards;Programming;Safety;Rail transportation;Encoding;Documentation","automatic test software;management of change;program verification;railway engineering;safety-critical software;software prototyping;software standards","regulated railway software development;safety-critical systems;European railway sector;EN 50128 international standard;systematic mapping;agile practices;test automation;coding standards;software integration;software validation;requirement analysis;change management","","12","","14","","10 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fact that the team had a limited number of high-end workstations forced it in a positive way to quick deployment and rigorous use of PP. The developers liked PP and learned it easily. Initially, the pairs were not rotated frequently but adopting daily, random rotation improved the situation. Frequent rotation seemed to improve knowledge transfer. The driver/navigator roles were switched seldom, but still the partners communicated actively. The navigator rarely spotted defects during coding, but the released code contained almost no defects. Test-driven development and design in pairs possibly decreased defects.

There are many ongoing initiatives to develop strategies to lower the high amount of emissions at the level of cities. However, energy planners face problems that are related to the complexity of the urban energy systems, encapsulating the components of the city together with their properties and interactions that are relevant to the planning process. The complexity of the problem increases given the unavailability of data and their multiple levels of detail (LOD). Therefore, there is a need for adequate tools to support the development of integrated energy strategies, defining specific quantifiable CO2 reduction measures to be implemented at the city level. In this research, we perform an analysis of urban energy planning processes. Then, we extract the general requirements of decision support in this discipline. Then, we perform a general data availability review in cities. This process results in formalizing a modular methodology for the development of urban energy planning support software. This methodology is specific to urban energy planning, it ensures the modularity of the development process, it leads to flexible software that operates under different available LODs of data, and it addresses the problem of data availability at the development stage.","1553-572X","978-1-4799-0224-8","10.1109/IECON.2013.6700392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6700392","ontology;energy planning support;software development methodology;decision support;semantics","Cities and towns;Planning;Software;Availability;Energy measurement;Buildings;Semantics","air pollution;decision support systems;environmental science computing;global warming;ontologies (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power system planning;software engineering;town and country planning","decision support;ontology;carbon dioxide reduction measurement;integrated energy strategies;multiple levels-of-detail;urban energy system complexity;energy related greenhouse gas emissions;urban energy planning support software development","","5","","16","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results need to be considered carefully since more empirical data are required to confirm the practitioners' opinion. In fact, studying socio-cultural differences is sensitive. Yet such information may be valuable for onshore teams (culturally homogeneous) as well as teams working on globally distributed projects.","","978-1-5386-2717-4","10.1109/ICSE-SEIP.2017.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965439","Agile Software Development;Process Improvement;Challenges;Cultural Differences","Cultural differences;Software;Context;Europe;Business;Software engineering;North America","cultural aspects;software prototyping;team working","agile software development methods;Asian cultural backgrounds;European cultural backgrounds;Belgium;Malaysia;Singapore;software development teams;Hofstede model;national cultures;socio-cultural differences","","21","","35","","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The level of use of project portfolio management capabilities is the level of organizational maturity in this area.The aim of this paper is to create a method for choosing the organization's maturity level in the field of project portfolio management.A method for assessing the maturity of an organization in the field of project portfolio management is proposed. The method is based on assessing the application of principles, functions, life cycle, specialized organizational structure, prescribed roles, and responsibilities for their implementation in managing a portfolio of projects. A distinctive feature of the method is that when evaluating, a generalized table of project portfolio management processes is used. The functions performed should be reflected in this table. Each function in the table has a given weight. Weights are also assigned to all other components of the project portfolio management approach.

Q-Rapids (Quality-aware Rapid Software Development) research project aims to support decision-makers for QRs management in RSD. The goal of this survey is to explore how software development organizations using RSD manage QRs. The survey focuses on: (a) how data is gathered for assessing decisions related to product evolution, (b) how QRs are managed, and (c) the considered QRs in their products. We received 30 responses, from them we can conclude that most of the companies gather data both automatically and manually; QRs are managed together with functional requirements, sometimes or very often functionality gets priority over quality; and, the most reported QRs are relia-bility, performance, and security.","","978-1-5386-8412-2","10.1109/QuaRAP.2018.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8501270","Quality Requirements;Non-functional Requirements;Agile;Rapid Software development;Survey","Tools;Companies;Software quality;Project management;Quality of service","decision making;software development management;software quality","functional requirements;software companies;software quality levels;software products;software life-cycle;QRs management;software development organizations;RSD manage QRs;quality requirements;rapid software development;software services;organizational capability;quality-aware rapid software development;q-rapids","","","","9","","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is due to the nature of first year students characterized by under-preparedness, poor academic background and so on. Moreover, the traditional lecture-based approach is used and the computer laboratories are rarely used. Consequently, students are not motivated, engaged or no active participation. While this teaching approach has failed to achieve learning outcome, incorporating cutting-edge practices like agile methods into the teaching could be valuable. This stems from the widespread in practice and acceptance of agile methods in the software industries today. Though agile practices like pair programming have impacted students' programming projects, none has been reported on teaching. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach of teaching CP using the agile methods. The goal is to assist beginners acquire needed programming skills, proffer teaching technique that maximizes the chances of engagement, active participation, and improving teaching by reflecting on what has been taught and what the students are learning. Additionally, beginners will be able to operate the computer, write correct code, gain better programming skills and assist teachers to manage large classes effectively.

The underlying goal of formative assessment is to lift the students to a higher metacognitive level where they can monitor and guide their learning while simultaneously improving their learning outcomes. However, many courses are planned before the semester starts and may not include methods to continuously improve the teaching. With continuous monitoring and assessment, the philosophy behind formative assessment has some similarities to the agile methodology often employed in software- and product development. This paper presents an agile framework for formative assessment in engineering courses.By taking the viewpoint of “Knowledge as a product”, this focus ensures: (1) that the students increase their knowledge through sprints and demonstrate it often, and (2), that the methods of teaching and learning are continuously improved through feedback from the students so that the teacher can adapt and improve to enable learning, all supported by formative assessment. Additionally, the agile approach to formative assessment has the potential to improve the non-technical professional skills of students.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9454060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454060","formative assessment;feedback;agile learning","Knowledge engineering;Conferences;Product development;Engineering education;Monitoring","cognition;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;further education;multimedia computing;teaching","formative assessment;continuous monitoring;agile approach;students","","","","27","","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agility is above all a mindset, being agile is quite simply being able to adapt to an environment that you know perfectly well, but which changes and is metamorphosed more or less slowly and which is never immutable and frozen. Various researches focused on the assessment of innovative teaching methods to promote the acquisition of professional skills (e.g. project-based learning, active and collaborative learning, etc.). In addition, adaptive learning is a pedagogical method favoring tailor-made eLearning to respond to the acquisition of certain skills, through the adaptation of pedagogical resources according to the learners’ needs. In this paper, we propose a new learning process essentially based on the four fundamental values of the agile manifesto. It is a challenge raised to attain the maximum organizational and strategic advantages with the implementation of these four agile values in secondary education.","","978-1-6654-3603-8","10.1109/INISTA52262.2021.9548383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9548383","Agile for education;Collaborative learning;Adaptive learning","COVID-19;Adaptive learning;Technological innovation;Adaptation models;Electronic learning;Project management;Collaborative work","computer aided instruction;DP management;groupware;project management","innovative teaching methods;professional skills;project-based learning;active learning;collaborative learning;pedagogical method;agile manifesto;agile adaptive learning process;contemporary approach;IT project management;iterative projects;information exchange;tailor-made eLearning","","","","15","","30 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, in many cases, architecture is accompanied with extensive documentation that requires significant effort to review and maintain throughout the development lifecycle. This paper presents a case study that aims at identifying difficulties architects and other stakeholders encounter when dealing with architecture documentation in agile development. The findings indicate that the architecture specification document is usually very long, complex, and not self-explanatory. In order to adjust the architecture documentation to the lean and minimal documentation approach of agile processes, we propose a considerably shorter abstract specification document, requiring reduced documentation efforts and resulting in a lean documentation that is easier to review, update, and communicate.","","978-1-4673-6290-0","10.1109/CHASE.2013.6614746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614746","Software architecture in agile development;architecture documentation","Computer architecture;Documentation;Software;Abstracts;Software architecture;Information systems;Face","abstracting;formal specification;large-scale systems;software architecture;software houses;software prototyping;system documentation","abstract specification document;architecture specification document;development lifecycle;up-front architecture artifacts;complex system development;enterprise products;software industry;agile development;architecture documentation","","14","2","14","","30 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software engineering researchers have spent considerable energy investigating ways to improve this situation by developing various processes, techniques, and tools over the last five decades. Understanding trends in the current state of the practice is crucial to identifying the challenges that software engineers face today, the changes their organizations are tackling, and how these challenges and changes impact industrial software production. This paper reports survey results from 99 software engineering developers and managers regarding their choice of process, technique, and tools, as well as their impressions as to the contributing factors towards project success or failure. In particular, the paper includes a focus on trends in adoption of agile practices. The data reinforces some known challenge areas such as the need for more effective communication. It also shows that there is a clear trend towards agile adoption across organizations, albeit traditional processes are still firmly entrenched in some areas. Scrum is the most common agile process in use, but it often gets adapted differently by different organizations, each according to their need. On the other hand, extreme programming was found to be almost non-existent in practice. The data also reveals that inadequate or unclear requirements are still the major problem that dogs the software industry. Similarly, a lack of rigorous time and cost estimation is commonplace. Together these two alone may explain the staggeringly high rate of software failures and delays. Finally, tool usage in industry varies quite widely; but there are certain areas (such as version control and unit testing) witnessing almost universal tool adoption.","","978-1-5386-1088-6","10.1109/STC.2017.8234457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8234457","","Software;Companies;Market research;Tools;Software engineering;Estimation","DP industry;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;software quality","software failures;universal tool adoption;multiperson software projects;software engineering researchers;agile practices;agile adoption;industrial software production;software engineering developers","","3","","15","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, estimation has played an important role in any type of software project and as well as for test projects. Particularly, the estimation of testing has been more critical and magnitude as companies need to present or bid their prices on the project to win the outsourcing contract. Wrong estimation can negatively affect the company sales in both ways. On the one side, the profit margin could be reduced or hurt when the bidding is less than that real effort. On the other side, the company could lose the project when the bidding is higher than that of competitors. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to apply economic and systematic estimation model or process to enhance the accuracy in estimation. The integration of highly skilled workforce and accurate test effort estimation software will provide significant benefits to companies. Up to now, there are various existing models of test effort estimation, yet use case point estimation is one of the most popular models in the agile software development industry. The present paper aims to investigate the use case point estimation model. Following the analysis, we have developed two important elements namely, efficiency and risk factor based on a new layer in the model developed by us. The benefit of the new model is to increase the performance and effectiveness of the use case point estimation model.","","978-1-4799-0425-9","10.1109/ICITEED.2013.6676222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6676222","Software estimation;use case point estimation;efficiency factor;risk factor;agile development;Outsourcing","Estimation;Companies;Outsourcing;Software;Training;Niobium","contracts;outsourcing;profitability;risk management;software cost estimation;software prototyping","user case point test effort estimation model;software outsourcing industry;software project;outsourcing contract;profit margin;economic model;systematic estimation model;agile software development industry","","9","","6","","2 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Reusable Learning Objects: An Agile Approach","R. P. Salas","Brandeis University,Computer Science Department,Waltham,Massachusetts,USA","2020 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","4 Dec 2020","2020","","","1","6","This ""Innovative Practice"" full paper discusses Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs) and to what extent they have lived up to the promise, particularly of reusability. Reusable Learning Objects have actually been discussed in the literature for the last 20 years and yet true large scale sharing of learning and teaching materials remains relatively rare and challenging. This paper argues that part of the reason is that the granularity of the learning objects that are in use today is not conducive to true reuse. Certainly whole PowerPoint slide decks and word documents are kept in individuals' folders; perhaps bits are cut and pasted and emailed around; but providence, permissions, tracking and tracing are ad-hoc and styling, formatting, templates, slide layouts need to be tended to repeatedly. It is not an ideal situation. As a result, educators, teachers, course designers, are constantly reinventing the wheel, or searching for where that one excellent assignment, explanation, definition was last seen so it can be copied forward.This paper argues that to achieve effective reuse of Learning Objects, the following are required: smaller, more granular (""micro"") learning objects; means to combine them into larger presentation products; and modern revision and version control. The paper proposes applying approaches originating in the software engineering community, such as agile methodology, version control and management, markup languages, and agile publishing, which together form the ""Agile Approach"" of the title of the paper. With that foundation laid, the paper examines ""CourseGen"", an open source software platform designed for creating, sharing, reusing and publishing reusable course content. CourseGen uses a modified markdown format augmented by CourseGen specific directives, such as $link to and $include topic. The CourseGen compiler converts a collection of CourseGen files into the final format such as a web site or a PowerPoint. CourseGen was designed, used and refined over the last three years in several Computer Science Courses at Brandeis University.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9273947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9273947","computer science education;course design;projects;teams;robotics","Tools;Education;Portable document format;Web sites;Search problems;Context;Wheels","computer aided instruction;configuration management;educational courses;program compilers;public domain software;software prototyping;software reusability;teaching","reusable learning objects;learning materials;PowerPoint slide decks;reusable course content;teaching materials;agile approach;word documents;software engineering community;version control;markup languages;agile publishing;CourseGen compiler;open source software platform","","","","11","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We'll consider model building within the framework of a software development exercise, and discuss how best practices from the broader software community can be applied for process improvement. In particular, we'll focus on the “milestones approach” to simulation development - based on the popular “agile software” philosophy and our own experiences in real-world simulation consulting practice.

We use a mixed method research strategy for creating a rich description of the factors that affect the quality of SRS in ASD. First, we conducted a systematic mapping study, then we performed a cross-case analysis of two software organizations: one small private organization and a large public organization. We built an initial model from this analysis. The findings were that SRS in agile projects should be directed to the development team, so it should be close to what will be implemented. The fragmentation of the description of the requirements in various artifacts and excessive detail were considered factors that compromise the quality of the SRS.","","978-1-5090-3581-6","10.1109/QUATIC.2016.058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814555","Requirements Specification;Agile Methods;Quality Factor;Empirical Study","Software;Context;Interviews;Organizations;Industries;Agile software development;Analytical models","software prototyping;software quality","software requirements specification quality;SRS quality;software industry;agile software development;ASD;agile projects;explanatory model;mixed method research strategy","","1","","28","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A challenge to integrate both approaches is that ASD relies mostly on tacit knowledge, hampering the reuse of software development assets. An opportunity to enable RDSE for ASD is by improving the traceability between user stories (USs), the most used notation to register product requirements in ASD. Having enough link semantics between USs could enable defining similarity between them and, consequently, promote RDSE for ASD. However, this is an open challenge. <italic>Objective</italic> - To propose a taxonomy for adding link semantics between USs, focusing on easing the task of identifying similar ones. Such links, with support of traceability tools, enable the reuse of USs and their related assets. <italic>Method</italic>: We constructed a taxonomy for types of US focusing on Web Information Systems. The taxonomy is used to classify the US, given two facets: module and operation. Such information is used to infer the similarity between USs using link rules. We developed the taxonomy based on an empirical analysis of five product backlogs, containing a total of 118 USs. Afterward, we validated the taxonomy in terms of its potential to enable the reuse of US-related assets. First, we executed an offline validation by applying it to classify 530 USs from 26 already ended projects. Finally, we applied the taxonomy in a case study with two ongoing projects (59 USs). <italic>Results</italic>: The proposed taxonomy for USs is composed of two sub-facets, namely, module and operation, which have, respectively, three and 18 terms. In terms of coverage, for the offline study and case study, we classified 90.17% of the USs with the proposed taxonomy. For the case study, we classified all the USs analyzed. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: We concluded that it is possible to use our approach to compare USs and, consequently, retrieve their related assets. Our results regarding its practical utility have shown that users considered the taxonomy a useful approach to ease the process of assessing the similarity between user stories.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2996951","CNPq and CAPES grants; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9106366","Agile software development;software reuse;user stories;information retrieval;technology acceptance model","Taxonomy;Software;Semantics;Tools;Task analysis;Software engineering;Companies","information systems;Internet;knowledge management;project management;software development management;software prototyping;software reusability","software development assets;taxonomy;user stories;agile software development;RDSE;ASD;link semantics;reuse-driven software engineering;USs;Web information systems;tacit knowledge;link rules","","5","","41","CCBY","2 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present our findings based on the data collected during five years of the long-lasting Distributed Software Development course running among three European universities. Student team decisions are analyzed on 19 distributed projects, carried out using the Scrum framework, and students' insights into this topic are discussed based on the data obtained from students' questionnaires and other course-related data sources. In addition, we investigate how this work division is related to the team dynamics, by analyzing teams' collaboration patterns and collaboration links between different team locations and work roles. The results show that although the students, in general, perceive the strong positive influence of architecture to the work division, younger generations of students tend to move away from dividing the work by location in order to form the sub-teams mixed by location, thus even improving the performance of their projects. A balanced collaboration, regardless of the physical location of sub-teams, might have a more beneficial effect on the quality of the resulting work than a strict work division over a distance.","","978-1-5386-9196-0","10.1109/ICGSE.2019.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807767","Global Software Engineering, Distributed Software Development, student teams, work division, software architecture, collaboration, education","Computer architecture;Software;Collaboration;Organizations;Software engineering;Task analysis;Industries","computer science education;decision making;distributed processing;educational courses;educational institutions;project management;software architecture;software prototyping;team working","software product;geographical locations;team dynamics;project work division;Distributed Software Development course;agile distributed student teams;architectural choices;student team decisions analysis;team locations;European universities;Scrum framework","","1","","20","","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They harness the capabilities of real-time data warehouses to equip the users with current data and enable them to make correct decisions. A typical real time Bl system transforms and loads data into a data warehouse as soon it appears in the source systems. This is achieved using a complex network of Database, Web and Application servers coupled with ETL server, source systems and the intranet. Developing and maintaining these Bl systems is a challenging activity where the biggest challenge lies in making the systems work with almost zero latency to make it truly 'real-time'. The paper cites why traditional waterfall methodologies fail to deliver in such projects and how agile methodologies like Scrum can be adopted in their place to ensure success. The paper is supplemented with a live case study of an Infosys Technologies Limited (NASDAQ:INFY) project that uses Scrum and Global Delivery Model (GDM) to successfully manage a complex project of developing and maintaining a Bl system right from the requirements elicitation phase.","","1-4244-1040-1","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2007.374652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258857","","Real time systems;Intelligent systems;Data warehouses;Network servers;Complex networks;Databases;Delay;Paper technology;Project management;Technology management","data warehouses;decision making;electronic commerce;file servers;intranets","realtime business intelligence systems;real-time data warehouse;decision making;Application server;Web server;database server;ETL server;source systems;intranet;Scrum;Infosys Technologies Limited;Global Delivery Model","","5","","4","","25 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, in recent years, the agile-type development method that repeats small releases is spreading as business environments change more intensely. For this reason, the development of a hybrid (HY)-type method that combines WF-type and agile-type development has attracted attention. Therefore, in this research, we report the result of examining the method that promotes rational development by considering the trade-off between cost reduction by simultaneous development of common objects as the overall optimality (the advantage of WF method) and early realization of value as local optimality (an advantage of agile method). For this purpose, we propose a method that achieves early realization of value and low cost by managing the relation between user stories and common objects in a matrix. Subsequently, we apply the proposed method to the basic design of a library information system and offer the results. In conclusion, we report cases where cost increases can be suppressed by delaying the value realization to some extent.","","978-1-5386-0621-6","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2017.149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8113260","Agile - waterfall hybrid method;User story;Feature;UML;Productivity","Reliability;Unified modeling language;Productivity;Delays;Information systems;Planning","business data processing;competitive intelligence;cost reduction;information systems;libraries;software engineering","common objects;library information system;user story development;agile-waterfall hybrid method;enterprise information systems;waterfall-type development method;high reliability;high efficiency;high estimation accuracy;agile-type development method;hybrid-type method;simultaneous development;WF method;agile method;rational development;large-scale projects;business environments;HY;WF-type;cost reduction;local optimality","","2","","10","","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advantages of utilizing these tools are building a channel for communication, organizing and prioritizing work, visibility, flexibility, and transparency. However, these tools don't provide guidance in early stages of development. This paper introduces a tool that injects a new developer-centric artifact called developer story. Developer stories are short, structural descriptions of a system blueprint. The tool directs Agile developers in creating the detailed design of a system early in the development stage, after which it generates the source code supporting the Design by Contract approach.

In it, Problem Based Learning (PBL) enabled the organization of an environment for diverse knowledge and skills, favorable to experimentation and prototyping of new models, methods, techniques, and tools. The application of the principles of agile methods aimed at overcoming difficulties related to the computer systems development, such as requirement changes, uncertainties, and risks, in order to improve quality. Unlike traditional methodologies, tests were used since the beginning of the development lifecycle with Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD). The agile testing quadrants guided the categorized elaboration of tests during unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing phases. The main contribution of this article was the integrated application of PBL, ATDD, and agile development in the case study of a Real-Time Embedded System for Unauthorized Access Control and Fraud Detection (Sistema Embarcado de Tempo Real para Controle de Acessos Indevidos e Deteccao de Fraudes -- SETRAIF).","","978-1-4799-3188-0","10.1109/ITNG.2014.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822167","unauthorized access control and fraud detection;problem based learning;agile methods;acceptance test driven development;agile testing quadrants","Testing;Prototypes;Robots;Real-time systems;Embedded systems;Computers;Business","computer science education;program testing;real-time systems;security of data","acceptance test driven development;problem based learning academic real-time system;interdisciplinary academic case study;computer system development;agile testing quadrants;unit testing;integration testing;system testing;acceptance testing;PBL;ATDD;agile development;real-time embedded system;unauthorized access control;fraud detection","","2","","25","","2 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It introduces a number of business-related issues in an estimation context such as Project scenarios for estimation purposes the probability of underestimation and the need for contingency funds, an example of contingency funds at the project level, managing contingency funds at the project portfolio level and the managerial prerogatives. The selection of a single number as the project budget is the result of a business and management decision and consists of the allocation to the project of an amount of money or effort within the estimated range. The obvious avenue to the effective and efficient management of contingency funds is to maintain them at portfolio level.","","9781118959305","10.1002/9781118959312.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=7111515.pdf&bkn=7111424&pdfType=chapter","","Estimation;Software;Portfolios;Uncertainty;Context;Project management;Sections","","","","","","","","3 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

There is often only one chance for mission success, and failure can be fatal. Although proximate causes of failure are often technical, root causes are usually mismanagement of the social context, leading to human error. Thus, while needing to maintain safety standards and faced with budgetary cuts and industry globalization, the space industry is driven to consider alternate methodologies by which to achieve success and limit failure. While Agile practices produce much interest within all aspects of mission-critical systems engineering, there is not much supporting data with respect to specific applicability of practices within the space industry. The need to review space-based systems engineering methodologies and to contemplate the applicability of disparate software engineering techniques, such as Agile, motivates the following research objective: The goal of this research is to identify which Agile practices, if any, are desirable and suitable for space-based systems engineering. Although some Agile practices may be discarded outright, others seem quite useful and should be given consideration. Scrum and extreme Programming (XP) show particular potential as does practicing hybrid approaches that combine Agile practices with existing formal methodologies and engineering standards.","","978-1-4799-5620-3","10.1109/SMC-IT.2014.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979143","mission-critical;systems development;agile;scrum","Software;Mission critical systems;Systems engineering and theory;Organizations;Context;Industries;Standards","aerospace computing;software prototyping;systems engineering","space-based systems engineering;safety requirements;performance requirements;mission criticality;safety standards;space industry;industry globalization;mission-critical systems engineering;software engineering;Scrum;extreme programming;engineering standards;formal methodologies;XP","","4","","10","","11 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A model and system for applying Lean Six sigma to agile software development using hybrid simulation","K. Ghane","Anagira, Inc., USA","2014 IEEE International Technology Management Conference","9 Oct 2014","2014","","","1","4","Software quality control and quality assurance have close ties with predictability, speed/time, and cost of software development. Process improvement has essential impact on these factors that drive the quality of software project outcomes. While stochastic design and process improvement methodologies based on the Lean Six Sigma can greatly help with process design and improvement, software development processes are substantially different from the processes in the other disciplines such as manufacturing or service operations that produce same/similar product/services. It's not feasible to quantify software processes in a discrete manner that is required by the Six Sigma methodologies. The discrete simulation that is used in operations such as car manufacturing relies on the fact that system activities change state at discrete time points. However this cannot be applied to software development as the activities are not repetitive and they have time estimates at best. The continuous simulation approach lacks the discrete simulation advantage of identifying inefficiencies and improving the processes along the line. Then the discrete simulation has the shortcoming of detecting consequences of improvements late in the process. The model and system introduced in this paper applies Six Sigma methodologies to software processes using hybrid simulation. It uses the relatively detailed empirical data - which the lean software development and agile methodologies produce - to simulate future activities. Such predictions are used as the baseline measurement data to assess the actual results of the continuous improvement activities. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to eliminate dependency on assumption of a specific distribution function for software development activities. The System also includes a framework for collecting process data and creating the empirical knowledge base that optimizes simulation, analytics and data mining. The System collects empirical data on process actors and uses them in simulation to provide estimations that incorporate the human factor that has substantial role in software processes. Over time the System effectively uses machine learning to improve estimation and in some cases to recommend actions to improve performance. The resulted data can be used not only for process improvement but also for evaluating impacts of factors such as outsourcing, geographical base cost, and time zone difference on the process quality.","","978-1-4799-3312-9","10.1109/ITMC.2014.6918594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918594","","Software;Six sigma;Capability maturity model;Monte Carlo methods;Estimation;Software measurement","data mining;digital simulation;human factors;learning (artificial intelligence);Monte Carlo methods;project management;six sigma (quality);software process improvement;software prototyping;software quality","machine learning;human factor;process actors;empirical data;data mining;Monte Carlo simulation;continuous simulation approach;discrete simulation;process improvement methodologies;stochastic design;software project outcome quality;software quality assurance;software quality control;hybrid simulation;agile software development;lean six sigma","","8","","19","","9 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is mostly because of the critical importance IT has in an organisation. According to [5], a good Business-IT alignment can help an organisation to keep up with their competition in a turbulent environment and can be achieved by developing enterprise architecture. The solution proposed by this paper deals with this issue by linking strategy models to each other and to implementation. This can ensure that no vital aspects of the strategic planning process are overlooked and that a smoother transition to organisational change is ensured. Also due to the links created between strategy and its implementation through enterprise architecture it becomes easier to determine how certain strategic choices can impact the architecture of an organisation, and also how certain projects would help an organisation achieve its goals.","","978-1-4673-6412-6","10.1109/ES.2013.6690089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690089","strategy model;enterprise architecture;strategic planning process;ArchiMate;Balanced Scorecard;Blue Ocean Strategy;Business Model Canvas;Dynamic Capabilities;Five Forces Framework;Marketing Mix;PEST analysis;Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix;Strategy Map;SWOT analysis","Strategic planning;Industries;Oceans;Analytical models;Organizations;Dynamics","enterprise resource planning;organisational aspects;strategic planning","enterprise architecture;agile alignment;business-IT alignment;turbulent environment;strategy models;strategic planning process;organisational change;organisation goals","","7","","30","","23 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current paper provides a short overview of the current developments of the profession. As well, it identifies related recent, current and ongoing research addressing similar questions regarding the success chances and rates of projects in light of the use and application of various PM methods. It aims to propose a new approach to learn using “Research through Project Management” (RtPM). Understanding the impact PM can have on the manner in which products, services, processes and systems are being developed, and the manner in which PM is performed. The authors propose the profession of PM will need to develop itself different from the way it has been conducted to-date and refer to it as “Towards Project Management 2030”, having the profession develop itself in a much more continuous manner.

The aim of this article is to propose a standardized framework suitable for developing countries for the technology roadmapping of large projects aimed to bring about systemic sociotechnical transitions. The framework is developed through the integration of existing generic technology roadmapping approaches with transition management theory and complex systems theory and was illustrated against a successful sociotechnical transition program that is characterized by Big Fast Results (BFR) requirements. Data were collected from qualitative interviews as well as from the critical analysis of relevant documents. The proposed sociotechnical transition technology roadmap accurately captured the key elements of the BFR project it was benchmarked against and even identified key elements that were not included in the BFR methodology. An advantage of the proposed sociotechnical transition technology framework is the fact that it makes use of a standard technology roadmapping process with few customizations that are ideal for use in developing countries.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3050812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9356725","Complex systems;developing countries;large scale projects;sociotechnical transitions;technology roadmaps","Technological innovation;Developing countries;Technology management;Technology planning;Roadmaps (technology planning);Industries;Government","developing countries;innovation management;project management;social aspects of automation;strategic planning;technology management","sociotechnical transition projects;developing countries;systemic sociotechnical transitions;generic technology roadmapping;transition management theory;sociotechnical transition technology roadmap;BFR project;standard technology roadmapping process;large-scale projects;developed countries;innovation ecosystems;complex systems theory;big fast results requirements;sociotechnical transition program","","","","48","IEEE","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mixed methods of interviews and focus group discussions with Scrum/Agile practitioners and experts in three UK IT sectors were conducted to investigate the farragoes of assumptions on how the Scrum process in particular deals with risks.

In order to move forward you must first let go, but you can't let go until you know what you are holding on to.","1095-323X","978-1-5386-6854-2","10.1109/AERO.2019.8741796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741796","","Task analysis;Organizations;Heart;Tools;Visualization;Contracts;Training","project management;software development management;software prototyping","unobvious social norms;agile development approaches;project management;customer satisfaction;customer involvement","","","","18","","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Project Management in Data Warehouse Implementations: A Literature Review","P. Bogojevic","Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia","IEEE Access","24 Dec 2020","2020","8","","225902","225934","Project management (PM) is a vital part of any data warehouse (DWH) implementation due to its complexity, time constraints, size, high costs, and importance to business. To help achieve efficient PM, project managers require a source of reference that aggregates the previously acquired body of knowledge (BOK) and presents the discovered findings. Yet, no such resource currently exits. Furthermore, no evaluation of the existing BOK has been made, which obstructs its current understanding and hinders future enhancements in the field. The goal of this paper is to remove these gaps by conducting a systematic review of the literature. The review identified 33 relevant studies. Results show that the current literature mostly covers global considerations and research on DWH requirements analysis techniques and that only a small number of studies were conducted to assist project managers. The review method incorporated two research dimensions used to synthesize, interpret and present the findings: the PMBOK® Guide's PM knowledge areas (PMKAs) and DWH stage. The majority of identified studies pertained to integration management, followed by scope management PMKAs. The biggest research gap was discovered for procurement management PMKA. The project initiation/planning DWH stage is most frequently analyzed in existing studies, followed by requirement analysis and database design. Findings from the identified studies are incorporated into a reference map in order to serve project managers as a reference point for additional guidance in their projects and an agenda for further research is provided for researchers looking to contribute to the field.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3045072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294006","Agile;data warehouse;literature review;project management;PMBOK guide","Bibliographies;Project management;Data warehouses;Software;Guidelines;Tools;Systematics","data warehouses;procurement;project management;software development management;systems analysis","body of knowledge;database design;PMBOK®;PMKA procurement management;PMKA scope management;DWH requirements analysis;integration management;literature review;data warehouse;project management","","","","112","CCBY","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Learning and adapting through constant algorithmic interventions aid in the development of a firm grasp of the situation at hand, as well as the handling of more difficult challenges as they arise. Cognitive psychology and knowledge-based applications engineering are at the heart of AI. AI-assisted quicker computing approaches are being used to address complex difficulties. Simultaneously, new, and more complicated issues emerge, which are difficult for the human mind to understand and envision, and which are far from being solved. Dynamic developments in global technical, economic, political, and environmental settings provide insurmountable challenges to corporate executives and strategists. Projects and project management are used to carry out business plans and government welfare goals. Throughout the project's timeframe, project managers must cope with restrictions. Regardless of methodology, predictive or iterative, the existence of various stakeholders and managing their requirements creates a slew of issues for the project manager and team. This paper aims to explain the existing industrial procedures employed by project managers that utilize AI principles. The author's aim is to set out obstacles and realistic alternatives for next generation project managers to apply AI in managing stakeholder expectations, resolving dissent and conflicts, and assuring flawless project delivery.","","978-1-6654-9761-9","10.1109/ICSSS54381.2022.9782273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9782273","Project management;Stakeholder management;Stakeholder engagement;Artificial intelligence;Project management analytics","Productivity;Presses;Decision making;Psychology;Project management;Machine learning;Natural language processing","artificial intelligence;decision making;government data processing;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects;project management;psychology;public administration","artificial intelligence smart tools;press;constant algorithmic interventions aid;firm grasp;knowledge-based applications engineering;AI-assisted quicker computing approaches;complicated issues;dynamic developments;global technical settings;economic settings;political, settings;environmental settings;insurmountable challenges;project management;project manager;AI principles;generation project managers;flawless project delivery","","","","19","IEEE","1 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are two main methodologies in the existing project management (PM): the Last Planner and Scrum, which are rooted in the foundation of the conventional PM doctrine: planning and control. When customers as co-creators are directly engaged in PM processes, the traditional concept of control in PM is unsuitable to a value co-creation project. Therefore, a new managerial methodology is essential for value co-creation activities in new PM. We apply the KIKI model for the new PM based on a service-centered view and a service systems thinking. The model is focused on value co-creation through knowledge creation by such steps as knowledge sharing; identifying needs; knowledge integrating; implementation to meet needs. Those steps are spirally developed such that the knowledge creating process is able to efficiently develop to convert into values. We verify the adaption of the KIKI model in PM through a case study in an English education project.

In agile, requirements are represented in the form of user stories. And the user stories are represented from the user's point of view. The user stories are effective only when the software practitioners are aware of the user story quality and customer value delivery. In this research work, we studied how well are the user stories used in practice. And are agile software practitioners using user stories and using them correctly? Furthermore, are they aware of the quality issues in the user stories? It was observed from our study that all agile practitioners do not use user stories. The results show that only 45% of agile practitioners used user stories. And only 14.81% of these practitioners had a sound understanding of user stories. This suggests that most of the agile software practitioners may not be using user stories correctly. Additionally, the results also show that backend developers do not seem to focus much on user stories when compared to frontend and most importantly the full-stack developers. Nonetheless, there is still a significant knowledge gap. Therefore, we see it as a general need to train and educate agile professionals about user stories so that they can be used in an effective way to generate customer value.","","978-1-7281-9675-6","10.1109/ICDABI51230.2020.9325670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9325670","user story;agile;INVEST;customer value","Software;Interviews;Industries;Data analysis;Tools;Standards;Stakeholders","customer satisfaction;human factors;software development management;software prototyping","user story;agile methodology;customer satisfaction;valuable software;customer value delivery;user story quality;agile oftware practitioners;agile professionals","","","","14","","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing approaches targeting agile development usually use release backlogs for predicting and setting delivery windows, however these do not consider the reliability of software for release date prediction so that there is a possibility that software at the predicted release date have poor reliability. Previously we proposed a generalized software reliability model (GSRM) based on a stochastic process and compared it with other models to evaluate recent software developments. However, we, did not directly evaluate the accuracy of the predicted release time by model. In this paper, towards prediction of release dates in agile development, we focus on the release dates of open source software (OSS) developments and the number of detected issues (faults) since OSS developments comply well with the definition of the agile development in terms of incremental process and frequent releases We define the accuracy of the predicted release time using the given development terms and the number of issues. Additionally, we propose a method to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted release time. In the best case, GSRM shows only 0.572% Error Rate, which corresponds to a predicted release date of two days prior to the actual release date. We believe that our method should be applicable to agile developments too.","","978-1-4673-7153-7","10.1109/Agile.2015.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284601","Software Reliability Model;Open Source Software;Release Time Prediction;Release Date;Agile Development","Software reliability;Mathematical model;Software;Predictive models;Uncertainty;Computational modeling","public domain software;software prototyping;software reliability","software release time prediction;agile development;incremental development characteristics;software release characteristics;release backlogs;delivery windows;open source software development;OSS development;fault detection;incremental process;frequent releases;GSRM;generalized software reliability model;error rate","","10","","29","","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first discuss the source and nature of complexity in software systems and how a probe - sense - learn approach recommended by the Cynefin Framework is appropriate for designing complex systems and a sense - analyse - learn approach is appropriate for developing a complicated system whose design has been determined. We then examine how quality assurance is incorporated into agile software development before pointing out that those characteristics of a self-managed team that produce so many benefits for software development of complex systems whose solution evolves with problem understanding, are also vulnerable to confirmation bias. This suggests that for safety critical system development, software systems developed by agile teams will need verification and validation by independent parties. We review current quality management practices for medical device software development before discussing how our earlier findings could be adopted into safety critical software quality management.","","978-1-5090-3581-6","10.1109/QUATIC.2016.016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814513","Safety critical;software development;complex systems;quality assurance","Production;Medical diagnostic imaging;Complex systems;Safety;Software systems;Quality assurance","medical information systems;program verification;quality assurance;safety-critical software;software metrics;software prototyping;software quality","quality assurance;agile safety-critical software system development;complex systems;agile software development methods;software system complexity;probe-sense-learn approach;Cynefin framework;sense-analyse-learn approach;self-managed team characteristics;confirmation bias;agile teams;software verification;software validation;medical device software development;safety critical software quality management","","1","","32","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an iterative approach for developing safety-critical software, making two novel contributions. Firstly, we address the notion of up-front design in safety-critical software development, and describe the characteristics fan up-front design that is minimal from the perspective of achieving safety objectives. Secondly, we identify a key difficulty of using iterative development for building safety-critical software, and present a way to develop both a software system and a safety argument iteratively.

However, these methods do not prescribe how improvement steps should be conducted in detail. In this research we investigate how agile software teams can use their development data, such as commits or tickets, created during regular development activities, to drive and track process improvement steps. Our previous research focused on data-informed process improvement in the context of student teams, where controlled circumstances and deep domain knowledge allowed creation and usage of specific process measures. Encouraged by positive results in this area, we investigate the process improvement approaches employed in industry teams. Researching how the vital mechanism of process improvement is implemented and how development data is already being used in practice in modern software development leads to a more complete picture of agile process improvement. It is the first step in enabling a data-informed feedback and improvement process, tailored to a team's context and based on the development data of individual teams.","2574-1934","978-1-7281-1764-5","10.1109/ICSE-Companion.2019.00081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8802669","agile;software development;Scrum;retrospective;software process improvement","Software;Interviews;Companies;Tools;Industries;Process control;Scrum (Software development)","iterative methods;project management;software development management;software prototyping","iterative process improvement;software teams;development data;data-informed process improvement;modern software development;agile process improvement;data-informed feedback;agile development methodologies;Scrum","","2","","25","","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To answer this question, it is not sufficient to know that there was poor project management, etc. Would it suffice to educate better project managers? And what would we have to teach them that they don't learn today? We have to know what actually took place in the projects, identify the root causes, and find ways to prevent them (cures). This is similar to accident investigations in aviation. This paper reports the results of five accident investigations of large government IT projects in Denmark. We identified 37 root causes and 22 potential cures. Surprisingly, only one of the causes is programming-related. Each project suffered from around 15 of the causes. Twenty-seven of the causes are not reported in the research literature on IT project failures (e.g. surprises with system integration and wrong estimate of human performance). Half of the cures are familiar to developers, but were ignored in the specific project (example: usability test).

Agile methodology is iterative in nature, with each iteration i.e. timebox lasting 2-6 weeks. Iterations involve small teams comprising 9-19 developers working through the entire software development life cycle. Agile methodology works on two basic principles. The first being regular adaptation to changing circumstances and the second -focus on technical excellence and good design and high quality code. The first principle accommodates that tasks in an agile project cannot be predicted more than a week in advance. Thus the need arises for project teams to incorporate experts in the problem domain, such that they are better equipped to handle changes rapidly. However this methodology has been criticised as it may not bring about the benefits intended by the second principle unless practised by skilled programmers, who can create high quality code. Hence a project manager should be equipped with a highly skilled team. We propose the utilization of a semantic agent, which will act on behalf of the project manager and suggest experts based on a set of parameters. Our semantic agent is based on a semantic matching algorithm. This algorithm utilizes an ontology based similarity framework to make recommendations and suggest training paths to satisfy the requirements of the project manager. The agent uses this algorithm to recommend employees based on their expertise, past experience and availability. Further, based on recommendations made by the agent we classify employees as experts and non experts and suggest knowledge transfer methods to upgrade their skills.","2327-0594","978-1-4244-6055-7","10.1109/ICSESS.2010.5552340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5552340","Agile Methodology;Semantic Agent;Semantic Matching Algorithm;Ontology;Knowledge Transfer","Ontologies;Semantics;Training;Classification algorithms;Availability;Databases;Knowledge transfer","decision support systems;iterative methods;knowledge acquisition;ontologies (artificial intelligence);personnel;semantic networks;software prototyping;training","decision support system;semantic agent;high quality solutions;enterprises;agile methodology;iterative methods;timebox;software development life cycle;technical excellence;high quality code;problem domain;skilled programmers;project manager;skilled team;semantic matching algorithm;ontology;training paths;employees;knowledge transfer","","1","","12","","19 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Program, Milwaukee Sch. of Eng., Milwaukee, WI; NA","The IET International Conference on Agile Manufacturing","8 Aug 2007","2007","","","78","86","Agility theory contends that internal and external cooperation arc essential factors for achieving agility. This study explores the internal aspect of this assertion by examining relationships between manufacturing agility and inter-group cooperation, competition and conflict at the manufacturing plant level. The results are based on a survey administered in 2005 to manufacturing facilities located primarily in the United States. Inter-group relationships are assessed for pairs of functional groups. It also compares results for pairs of groups both located within the manufacturing plant and pairs in which some or all of one group is located at the company headquarters. A simple linear regression model indicates that conflict is significantly related to manufacturing agility, although it accounts for little of the total variation. Analysis of specific functional pairs shows that Management/Production and Purchasing/Production have high levels of cooperation. Surprisingly, inter-group relations were found to be similar when both groups were located in- plant and when some or all of one group was located at headquarters, with two important exceptions: cooperation is significantly impaired for the Production/Production Planning and Control (PPC) pair and the Production/Human Resources (HR) pair when some or all of PPC or HR are located at headquarters. The exploratory findings, from a survey of 54 manufacturing plants, suggest that internal cooperation is not essential to achieving agility, that conflict or the recognition of conflict might be positively associated with agility, and that most dispersed functional groups can have similar inter- group relations as those co-located in the same production facility.","","978-0-86341-816-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286477","","","agile manufacturing;human resource management;industrial plants;production control;production planning;purchasing;regression analysis","manufacturing agility;manufacturing plant;manufacturing facilities;United States;linear regression model;purchasing;production planning;production control;PPC;human resources;production facility","","","","","","8 Aug 2007","","","IET","IET Conferences"

They may be asymptomatic or may give rise to undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The number of dengue cases at Jember reported increased from 77 in 2011 to 923 in 2015 and case fatality rate exceeded 1.3 in 2011 and over 1.6 in 2015. The main obstacles of dengue surveillance are occurred due to lack of public response to the onset of dengue viral infections cases in the surrounding environment, reporting cases from the hospitals, clinics, or community health centre have been delayed because of accessibility factor and manual written report. Without the validity of the information from dengue patient data, epidemiological investigation can't provide valuable information to control ongoing outbreaks. To overcome these problems, the development of prevention information system of dengue viral infections plays crucial role in the identifying cases and obtaining information from them to decide what actions must be taken by Health Department of Jember to control and eliminate outbreaks. To build robust prevention information system is used the hybrid model to combine both Waterfall and Agile. Leveraging both the Waterfall and Agile approach ensures the success of the project. It removes the disadvantages of both the models while bringing together the advantages of both. The objective of this paper is to highlight the importance of the hybrid model to successfully develop and implement prevention information system of dengue viral infections at Jember to restrict mosquito-borne spreading.","2157-099X","978-1-5090-4417-7","10.1109/ICTKE.2016.7804090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7804090","DF;DHF;DSS;prevention information system;dengue viral infections;Waterfall;Agile;Scrum;Hybrid model","Decision support systems","diseases;epidemics;medical information systems","hybrid model;epidemiological investigation;DSS;dengue shock syndrome;DHF;dengue haemorrhagic fever;DF;dengue fever;undifferentiated fever;mosquito-borne diseases;Indonesia;East Java;Health Department of Jember;dengue viral infections;prevention information system;agile-waterfall hybrid","","2","","11","","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mostly, companies embrace GSD without prior knowledge of its issues and as a result fail in the management of its process and outcomes of the project. Major reason behind this failure is poor project management practices that do not fit into the GSD context.

Project manager (PM) competences are important in project success. Yet, current competence studies largely rely on small-sample, homogenous PM surveys which could suffer from uncontrollable biases and may not be generalizable. Often, the studies disregard industry specificity. We attempt to address these issues by exploring the key competences employers require from PMs across multiple industry sectors. We code the contents of 2306 online project management job advertisements in the U.K., the U.S., Canada, China, India, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore for frequently occurring keywords. Using three-way multidimensional scaling (MDS), we extract six dimensions of competence present in the coded keywords: 1) industry-specific and generic skills over project management knowledge/expertise; 2) project management knowledge/expertise over industry-specific and generic skills; 3) (senior) managerial skills; 4) (positive) personal traits; 5) project management methodology experience and professional qualifications; and 6) risk management over a project life cycle. We find that typically industry puts more weight on generic skills than project management knowledge/expertise, replicating previous PM survey-based results. We believe, however, that the main contribution is our finding that different industry sectors place significantly different levels of salience on the six dimensions. We discuss the practical implications of the results.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2012.2215330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6324429","Competence salience;industry specificity;multidimensional scaling (MDS);project manager (PM) competences","Industries;Project management;Stress;Education;Organizations;Standards organizations;Humans","employment;personnel;project management;risk management","multidimensional analysis;project manager competence;project success;PM competence;employer;online project management job advertisement;UK;US;Canada;China;India;Hong Kong;Malaysia;Singapore;three-way multidimensional scaling;industry-specific skill;generic skills;project management knowledge-expertise;managerial skills;personal traits;project management methodology experience;professional qualifications;risk management;project life cycle","","63","","44","IEEE","5 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Software development methodologies are designed to improve the quality of software by incorporating practices that promote quality in the developed software. Software security is an important facet of software quality, particularly in this era, where most software is deployed for use over the Internet. Most research on developing high-quality and secure software is normally focused on teams at the expense of individual developers. In trying to fill this gap, in this paper we propose an agile secure-software development methodology. We design a methodology that promotes quality and security in the software products of solo developers. We integrate quality practices with lightweight security practices to produce agile secure software development practices. We draw quality practices from a solo software development framework designed in our previous study, while security practices are drawn from existing lightweight methodologies. We adapt Keramati and Mirian-Hosseinabadi's algorithm to integrate the two sets of practices, taking care to maintain an optimum degree of agility in the target methodology. We evaluate the utility of the resultant methodology through a case study. Results from the case study show that our proposed methodology can be used to build quality and secure software products without compromising the agility of the methodology.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8978533","Agility degree;quality practices;security practice;software development methodology;software product;software quality;software security;solo developer","Security;Software quality;Tools;Business;Design methodology;Software algorithms","Internet;security of data;software quality","software security;software quality;secure-software development methodology;lightweight security practices;agile secure software development practices;lightweight methodologies;novel lightweight solo software development methodology;optimum security practices","","4","","33","CCBY","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Also, there was lack of visibility into projects entering and progressing in the development pipeline. No structured way of starting projects was enforced company-wide, and too many parallel projects got started. As a result of introducing a structured portfolio management process, the number of ongoing projects has dramatically reduced, from over 200 to 30, reducing thrashing. Listing all projects in priority order in the Paf.com backlog provides visibility into what is currently ongoing, helping coordinate the work of multiple Scrum teams.

By comparing different agile methods, managers can easily choose the agile method that best suites his project requirements and organizational characteristics. Different comparison techniques to compare agile methods were introduced in recent years by researchers. We have compared the agile methods Adaptive Software Development and Feature Driven Development in order to evaluate their degree of agility and coverage degree with respect to the two Knowledge Areas of SWEBOK, (1) Software Requirements, (2) Software Construction. The result of our comparison shows that Adaptive Software Development mainly differs from Feature Driven Development because there are no predefined techniques or specific practices that are meant to be followed in Adaptive Software Development. Feature Driven Development has some predefined techniques or practices that are to be followed during software development. The principle of Adaptive Software Development is to focus more on results rather than steps to achieve that result. A technique is only implemented if it is necessary to get the best output in Adaptive Software Development.","","978-1-4577-1587-7","10.1109/ICCSNT.2011.6181977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6181977","Agile Method;ASD;FDD;Agile manifesto;SWEBOK","Software;Unified modeling language;Complexity theory;Variable speed drives;Programming;Publishing;Adaptation models","software prototyping","adaptive software development;feature driven development;agile methods;customer participation;customer satisfaction;software development life cycle;Scrum;extreme programming;software requirements;software construction;SWEBOK","","3","","10","","12 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"An education model for project-based learning using ability map in various target products","N.

Most features of the model support various products such as the system software, web application, IoT program, and multimedia contents. Even if PBL products differ among the PBL education classes, fair student evaluations can be achieved because the meta models are dependent only on the maturity levels of the student abilities, and not the quality of the final products. In addition, the model was constructed based on empirical data of previous PBL projects. Based on this model, we conducted PBL classes in 2018 and 2019 at a university. The projects were focused on a business web application, project mapping system, programmable drone, and dynamic movie changing system. The students increased not only their programming techniques as novice members but also their project management techniques as team leaders through the four different projects conducted during the PBL classes. As a result, the teachers were able to fairly evaluate each student even though the final products of the PBL classes differed. At the same time, the students were able to grow as project managers or program specialists that they selected.","2640-0715","978-1-7281-9553-7","10.1109/APSEC51365.2020.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9359314","Project-based learning;empirical education model;ability map;multiple concurrent projects;project management education","Multimedia systems;Education;Project management;Motion pictures;System software;Programming profession;Software engineering","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;programming;project management;software development management;teaching","project mapping system;dynamic movie changing system;project management techniques;PBL classes;target products;resource pyramid meta model;education process meta model;ability mapping meta model;PBL education classes;fair student evaluations;student abilities;project-based learning;programmable drone;business Web application","","","","15","","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The Odyssey: Modeling Privacy Threats in a Brave New World","R. Galvez; S. Gurses",NA; NA,"2018 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops (EuroS&PW)","9 Jul 2018","2018","","","87","94","In the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy by design and privacy impact assessments are given an even more prominent role than before. It is now required that companies build privacy into the core of their technical products. Recently, researchers and industry players have proposed employing threat modeling methods, traditionally used in security engineering, as a way to bridge these two GDPR requirements in the process of engineering systems. Threat modeling, however, typically assumes a waterfall process and monolithic design, assumptions that are disrupted with the popularization of Agile methodologies and Service Oriented Architectures. Moreover, agile service environments make it easier to address some privacy problems, while complicating others. To date, the challenges of applying threat modeling for privacy in agile service environments remain understudied. This paper sets out to expose and analyze this gap. Specifically, we analyze what challenges and opportunities the shifts in software engineering practice introduce into traditional Threat Modeling activities; how they relate to the different Privacy Goals; and what Agile principles and Service properties have an impact on them. Our results show that both agile and services make the end-toend analysis of applications more difficult. At the same time, the former allows for more efficient communications and iterative progress, while the latter enables the parallelization of tasks and the documentation of some architecture decisions. Additionally, we open a new research avenue pointing to Amazon Macie as an example of Machine Learning applications that aim to provide a solution to the scalability and usability of Privacy Threat Modeling processes.","","978-1-5386-5445-3","10.1109/EuroSPW.2018.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406565","privacy by design;threat modeling;software development;agile;services;challenges;opportunities","Privacy;Security;Data privacy;Service-oriented architecture;Documentation","data protection;service-oriented architecture;software prototyping","Privacy Threat Modeling processes;threat modeling methods;security engineering;GDPR requirements;engineering systems;waterfall process;monolithic design;Agile methodologies;Service Oriented Architectures;agile service environments;privacy problems;software engineering practice;Agile principles;Service properties;General Data Protection Regulation","","4","","38","","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We evaluated our approach on ten agile case study projects obtained from the Taiga. io repository. In order to determine the TaskAllocator's performance, we have conducted a benchmark study by comparing it with contemporary machine learning models. The applicability of the TaskAllocator was assessed through a plugin that can be integrated with JIRA and provides recommendations about suitable roles whenever a new task is added to the project. Lastly, the source code of the plugin and the dataset employed have been made public.","","978-1-6654-1401-2","10.1109/ICSSP-ICGSE52873.2021.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461028","Distributed agile software development;task allocation;natural language processing","Training;Text categorization;Project management;Machine learning;Benchmark testing;Tools;Software","learning (artificial intelligence);project management;software development management;software prototyping;software quality","benchmark study;contemporary machine learning models;suitable roles;recommendation approach;role-based tasks allocation;agile software development;incoming tasks;potential befitting roles;team roles;individual persons;project managers;individual developers;agile case study projects;TaskAllocator performance","","1","","37","","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An empirical study aiming to evaluate the productivity impact of the proposed hybrid process was carried out in a Brazilian CMMI v.1.1 Maturity Level 2 medium-sized company. Five groups of similar projects were compared with respect to productivity, some of which were developed using the new hybrid process and others were developed using the older RUP-based process. Quantitative results have shown that four out of five project groups showed significant productivity increase in Scrum-RUP projects.

In this study, the focus group technique was used to explore and understand the HRM processes employed by the mature POO with a specific focus on their requirements and dependencies. The study was conducted within one of the leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies in South Africa. The organisational strategy is the driver of the HRM processes in the mature POO. POO's spend a significant amount of time and resources to hire new employees. It is therefore important that the right resources are appointed. The research results identified that the HR planning and recruiting processes are the key processes in the mature POO.

The selected portfolio must consume the resources necessary for the implementation of projects that constitute it. These resources have become increasingly limited. Project prioritization becomes necessary to execute projects that will generate maximum revenues to the company. Thus, project prioritization process, however, have many limitations. On one hand, these processes are complex and are characterized by achieving multiple objectives, conflicting and difficult to measure. Furthermore, they are subject to many constraints from the inaccuracy of the data used in the estimation cycle, until the uncertainty on the values used in the analysis. Moreover, the information available to decision makers, to build these processes is often incomplete. A valid formal process to all organizations does not exist.

This paper addresses the topic of theme-based release planning. Themes might be defined, manually, upfront or as the result of computer-based analysis. In this paper, we propose an analytical approach to detect themes from a given set of feature dependencies. On top of an existing release planning methodology called EVOLVE II, our approach applies clustering performed on a feature dependency graph. The release plans generated from such an approach are a balance between two goals: (i) considering the values of individual features, (ii) detecting and utilizing synergy effects between semantically related features. As a proof-of-concept, we present a case study addressing the theme-based release planning for 50 features of a text processing system.

This new team member faces a number of challenges before they are integrated into the team and can contribute productively to team progress. Ideally, each newcomer should be supported in this transition through an effective team onboarding program, although prior evidence suggests that this is challenging for many organisations. Objective: We seek to understand how Agile teams address the challenge of team onboarding in order to inform future onboarding design. Method: We conducted an interview survey of eleven participants from eight organisations to investigate what onboarding activities are common across Agile software development teams. We also identify common goals of onboarding from a synthesis of literature. A repertory grid instrument is used to map the contributions of onboarding techniques to onboarding goals. Results: Our study reveals that a broad range of team onboarding techniques, both formal and informal, are used in practice. It also shows that particular techniques that have high contributions to a given goal or set of goals. Conclusions: In presenting a set of onboarding goals to consider and an evidence-based mechanism for selecting techniques to achieve the desired goals it is expected that this study will contribute to better-informed onboarding design and planning. An increase in practitioner awareness of the options for supporting new team members is also an expected outcome.","1949-3789","978-1-7281-2968-6","10.1109/ESEM.2019.8870189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870189","Agile teams;onboarding;software engineering","Software;Interviews;Agile software development;Planning;Organizations;Protocols;Google","organisational aspects;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;team working","team member;team progress;effective team onboarding program;onboarding activities;Agile software development teams;common goals;onboarding goals;onboarding design;onboarding design;repertory grid instrument;evidence-based mechanism;onboarding planning","","3","","38","","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the team and team leaders share leadership, leadership is rotated to the person with the key knowledge, skills, and abilities for the particular issues facing the team at any given moment. Therefore, we argue that the team leadership in Scrum should be divided among the Product-owner, Scrummaster, and the self-organizing team. If teams are to succeed at implementing shared leadership in Scrum, not only do the vertical (or traditional) leaders need training and development but so too do the team members themselves.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3450-3","10.1109/HICSS.2009.480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755768","","Programming;Project management;Software development management;Information science;Humans;Feedback;Teamwork;Adaptive systems;Communication system control;Collaborative software","software development management;team working","shared leadership;agile development;agile software development methods;self-organizing teams;team-members;managerial decisions;self-managed team;team leadership;product-owner;Scrummaster","","2","","37","","20 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quality characteristics such as flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility, whose importance is increasing in the context of Industry 4.0, are thus becoming harder to achieve. These challenges can only be solved through sound architectural design. While there is a common understanding of good software architecture and appropriate methods to achieve it in computer science, a suitable architecture definition for automation software that takes all relevant factors into account is still missing in the field of CPPS. Therefore, based on a workshop with international scientists with different perspectives on CPPS, this paper presents influencing factors on automation software architecture.

Still, in embedded and safety critical domains there is somehow the expectation that the approach be “more” plan-based; at least, many of the current normatives seem to lean toward such approach. A definite change in attitude has emerged with the latest DoD standards in the United States; in Italy, this change has been introduced through a new initiative taken at the 4th Logistic Division of the General Staffs of the Italian Army. This paper reports on this new initiative.Given the recent budget cuts and the concurrent but opposite need to develop a new software system, the General Staff of the Italian Army has decided to partially internalize its software development, asking their contractors to build a mix of military-civilian development teams, composed of around 6-10 developers, and to organize the overall development using an adaptation of Scrum. To this end, the two top officers of the Division have received the appropriate training to become Certified Scrum Product Owners. The project started with one team and, after about one year of operation, has grown to about seven teams, partially geographically distributed. The teams feature approximately one third of military people and two thirds of civilian developers, mostly with an education equivalent to an MSc in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or closely related area. Data about the production process has been collected following a non-invasive approach. The results have been impressive and reassuring on the approach, even if criticality has emerged with respect to a natural resistance toward change and the need of support at the highest possible level to ensure the perdurance of the selected process.The defense software development process is a highly complex endeavor because it has to deal with a complex domain, it has to provide a very high quality solution and it has to satisfy very specific and complex needs. Command and Control software in particular must meet functional requirements that are often extremely detailed as the situations that create them involve a large number of assets and human resources that have to be coordinated in a way that minimizes losses, as any trade-offs may result in the loss of lives.Additionally, defense operations are conducted in conformance with a specific set of strategic rules called “doctrine,” and are further specified in very minute detail in a set of operational manuals that are meant to create familiarity in a series of tasks that have to be executed in difficult situations, e.g., under strict time constraint or in the presence of unknown threats.At the same time, considerable freedom must exist to choose the most favorable course of action, given that the situation evolves continuously and often in unpredictable ways. In a command and control system, for example, the leader in charge of the operations must be able to decide the courses of action for any units under his or her control; and these actions must be communicated rapidly and reliably to any and all such units. The feedback loop is also crucial to understand how the situation evolves in the field.Given the environment in which defense software needs to operate, it is not surprising that until recently, most of the software development process was plan-based: that is, processes that would ensure a high repeatability and predictability. In fact, process standards have been developed by defense agencies and armed forces to prescribe a series of features that every defense software development effort should possess (Benedicenti et al., 1999).In recent years, however, a number of factors have come to disrupt this plan-based software development process culture inside defense, the most disruptive of which has been the change in the very nature of defense efforts. Whereas traditional conflicts have involved symmetrical opponents, and most doctrines have made that assumption at their very core, recent events prove that more and more conflicts involve asymmetric opponents.Evident examples of this change are the fight against terrorism and organized crime. In these situations, a large and highly structured force is poised against a smaller but nimbler contingent. The two opponents often have profoundly different value systems and cultures, which makes very difficult to construct effective strategies without incurring in uncomfortably high risks.This rapid change introduced by asymmetrical opponents has a profound impact on the software development effort. Whereas in the past requirements were very detailed and complex but relatively fixed, recent requirements have become more volatile although they remain equally detailed. This dichotomy cannot be addressed using a standard plan-based development process (Boehm and Turner, 2003).Another disruptive factor is the cost of software development. While the complexity and volatility of requirements increases, the cost of developing a system also increases accordingly. In our experience with the Italian Army, the cost traditional defense software development has risen to approximately 130 Euro per line of code. In of itself, the rising cost of development would not be disruptive, but when it is associated with a considerable reduction in the defense budget and the need for frequent requirement changes, it becomes such (Martinelli 2015).To address the problem described above, we hypothesized that agile development can be an adequate approach for developing software in the defense sector even for mission critical applications. To this end, it is worth recalling how some of the tenets of agile can be structured in the production of software for defense (Cotugno 2015; Messina 2015), in particular with respect to the following aspects:•Frequent releases•Change management•Effective cooperation in a complex environment between requirements owners (goal owners), acquisition owners (gold owners), and contractors, who are numerous in the defence sector and do not traditionally interact easily with one another•Focus on small and empowered teams, to be able to react fast to evolving customer needs and emergency situations, a mentioned in the previous sectionImplementing a Scrum derived agile software development cycle in the Italian Army has required a great effort both for the technical and cultural change. This effort can be summarized by the four “pillars” of effort. The second “pillar” is the most critical since no specific innovative tools are available and the current implementation of the development environment are based on the adaptation of “traditional” software tools and experimental products.The first “pillar” was needed to instill the initial knowledge within the organization. The third “pillar” was necessary to create a user community governance structure which could authorize selected experts to act as delegated “Product Owners” with the same decision power as their heads. This step also required the involvement of the top level authority in the Army. The other pillars have been developed in parallel and are still under construction. It was necessary to create a brand new training process capable of generating agile agents able to act as Product Owners and Scrum Masters in the mission-critical software arena. Probably the most critical “pillar” to build was, and still for the most part is, the innovative CASE tool suite to support and assist software development. To this end traditional tools have been adapted and some new ones have been generated. The criticality is the non-invasive nature of the tools. If the programmers’ time has to be allocated to feed the support environment, the effectiveness of the production cycle decreases. Last but not least a doctrine had to be developed to ensure that any replica of the process throughout the military environment be coherent with the “Italian Army Agile” methodology.The agile approach adopted in this project is based on Scrum. The defense environment, however, required a few changes to make this approach effective. The first step was to obtain a Scrum Alliance certification for key project members. This was achieved relatively painlessly; but creating an agile culture in a plan-based environment required a serious change management effort, as previously discussed. By taking advantage of the pre-existing hierarchical structure of the Italian Army to instill a sense of need, we created the motivation to adopt the new agile method. We then closed the virtuous loop through the standard mechanisms of Scrum enabled through the four pillars mentioned above. As the first few sprints proved the incremental nature of Scrum, delivering increasingly more functional prototypes, the team’s level of confidence in the process grew accordingly.Even though Agile Methods have been discussed for, at least, the last 15 years, there are no conclusive studies on their effect or on the effect of some of their practices. An earlier study of some of the authors of this paper (di Bella et al., 2013) focusing on Pair Programming reported that from 1998 to 2011 there were 30 comprehensive studies, and among these studies there there is a tendency to show that Pair Programming has positive effects on quality, albeit with major concerns. However, there is no convincing statement on the effects of Pair Programming on productivity.Since then a few additional works have appeared but they have not clarified such relations. In particular, the meta-analytical study of Rafique and Mišić (2013), has shown the lack of evidence (or even the presence of counter evidence) of the positive effects of test-driven development (another agile practice) on productivity, especially in industrial settings. Moreover, apart from the aforementioned study by di Bella et al. (2013), most works relate either to academic settings or to small experimentations.The novelty of this paper therefore lies on:• the military domain of the study, which is substantially completely unexplored in other studies,•the very large size of the experimentation - 17 months for a growing team of up to 7 teams,•the fact that productivity is fully considered as part of the analysis and that there is clear evidence of the (positive) effect of the adopted agile methodology on productivity.Under each of these three perspectives the results of the poster are innovative and unique.After slightly more than a year in the process, the timeframe described in this paper, the Italian Army has 7 Agile Teams in place and working. The full Scrum of Scrums complex production line is active and synchronized. The teams are turning on progressively taking charge of the full architecture of an overarching strategic Command and Control tool that implements full spectrum of the decision support activity, stretching from the facilities management to the operational Field Application Services (FAS). The project is still evolving past its initial release and has now stabilized on a 5-week sprint delivery cycle.In addition, major benefits were found in the dramatic increase of customer satisfaction which was driven by the incorporation of final user experts into the development teams. Although it is very difficult to run an effective comparison with former projects it is safe enough to say that the current level of satisfaction of the operational user of the C2 system developed is higher than 90% since none of the sprint deliveries failed to receive the approval from final users.","","978-1-4503-4205-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883385","Empirical Software Engineering;Agile Processes;Defence Software;Scrum;Non-invasive Measurement Systems","Software;Software engineering;Scrum (Software development);Productivity;Programming;Standards","military computing;safety-critical software;software prototyping","scrum application;agile methods;production process;hackers;cowboy coders;embedded domains;safety critical domains;plan-based approach;DoD standards;United States;Italy;Italian army;software system development;military-civilian development teams;certified scrum product owners","","","","18","","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To demonstrate the practical value of our models, we run a number of simulations on hypothetical MBT adoption and use scenarios, which can be realistically applied to different teams considering adopting MBT.","","978-1-6654-4456-9","10.1109/ICSTW52544.2021.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9440151","Model Based Testing;MBT;cost;deployment;agile;SCRUM","Software testing;Feedback loop;Conferences;Tools;Software;Data models;Planning","personnel;program testing;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping","software testing;traditional testing processes;team leaders;hypothetical MBT adoption;adopting using Model-Based;agile SCRUM teams;Model-Based testing;software development teams","","","","8","","28 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main goal is to handle the consumer demand for customized products. Recent developments in research, engineering and technology enable industries to move from profitable linear assembly lines to profitable non-linear, dynamic assembly lines to satisfy such a demand. Industry 4.0, a German governmental initiative, encourages industries to use interconnected Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to create context-sensitive and decentralized factory environments. CPSs in combination with tracking technologies and a component based assembly line can create a factory environment that allows customers to change their requirements during assembly-time. Such change is typically not considered in the domain of manufacturing. In modern software engineering projects, agile techniques allow customer change during the entire development phase. Such change results in customer oriented, customized software products. In this paper we describe the development of an Agile Factory prototype. The developed Agile Factory prototype transfers agile software engineering techniques to the domain of manufacturing. It explores the impact and feasibility of customer changes during assembly-time using a commercially available software framework. The assembly line of the Agile Factory is component based, using track able mobile worktables in combination with stationary workstations. Therefore, each product with its associated request is track able during assembly-time which enables us to implement a customer feedback loop. The feedback loop allows change requests during assembly-time. Without the integration of such tracking techniques a customer feedback loop is very difficult up to impossible to implement. We created a Cyber-Physical Human System (CPHS) using smart factory-hardware in combination with an accepted manufacturing software framework. We bridge the virtual and physical world enabling the customer and the factory worker to communicate with actual physical objects.","","978-1-4673-7785-0","10.1109/CPSNA.2015.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272683","Cyber-Physical System;Cyber-Physical Human System;Manufacturing;Industry 4.0;Agile Methods;Agile Factory","Production facilities;Software;Prototypes;Workstations;Assembly;Mass customization","agile manufacturing;assembling;mass production;product customisation;production engineering computing;production facilities;software prototyping","Industry 4.0 manufacturing process;mass customization;customized products;German governmental initiative;interconnected cyber-physical systems;decentralized factory environments;context-sensitive factory environments;software engineering projects;customized software products;Agile Factory prototype transfers agile software engineering techniques;assembly line;customer feedback loop;cyber-physical human system;smart factory-hardware;manufacturing software framework","","28","","16","","21 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a properly managed project in a matured software engineering environment can consistently achieve this goal. This research is concerned with the methodologies that examine the life cycle of software through the development models, which are known as software development life cycle. Hereby, we are representing traditional i.e. waterfall, Iteration, Spiral models as well as modern development methodologies like Agile methodologies that includes Extreme programming, Scrum, Feature Driven Development, Component based software development methodologies etc. All of these models have advantages and disadvantages as well. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to represent different models of software development by showing the good and bad practices of each model.

To be effective, project teams should master processes, personal, technical and business competencies. The teaching of project management could be adapted in order to reduce the gap that seems to exist between the engineer graduate profile and the requirements that challenge professional engineers today, namely equipping new engineers with sound soft skills. Generation Z, currently studying in HEIs, has characteristics, needs and expectations that should be considered when discussing potential changes in project management education. This paper explores these topics. The literature review establishes the characteristics of generation Z, project management teaching trends, and draws implications for the teaching of project management within the scope of engineering education. A sample of 147 Generation Z undergraduate students filled a self-report questionnaire considering personality, resilience and emotional intelligence to assess their awareness about the traits that are relevant for project management. Through their self-assessment results, the participating students are aware of some of their characteristics, namely orientation towards results, high resilience and low neuroticism. Due to the high resilience indicators and low levels of neuroticism, Generation Z can be an important asset within a multigenerational project team. Also, some inconsistencies were identified as the participants displayed high levels of agreeableness and low levels of openness to experience. These results are discussed, linking personality traits of Generation Z with some important soft skills in project management, including teamwork and communication skills. Finally, recommendations and approaches for teaching project management in engineering education programs are presented.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-0930-5","10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125144","Engineering Education;Generation Z;Project Management","Industries;Force;Project management;Globalization;Market research;Teamwork;Planning","computer aided instruction;engineering education;globalisation;project management;teaching","communication skills;teamwork;Generation Z students;neuroticism;student emotional intelligence;student resilience;student personality;undergraduate students;teaching project management;multigenerational project team;project management teaching trends;project management education;engineering education","","2","","51","","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though prior research has studied IT project failures/success, there are relatively few studies that have examined the evolution of project scope during its implementation, which is salient in the case of innovative information systems projects. The current research argues that changes to the project scope occur all through the implementation lifecycle and the project definition is shaped by multiple factors - exogenous and endogenous to the project. Through a detailed analysis of over 350 IT project change requests issued in the context of two technological programs implemented by Canadian financial institutions, we trace the project shaping process and assess the impact of the triggering factors on the initial project definition.

As change becomes central to the life of organizations, the ability to reconfigure operations becomes vital for success. However, the current takes on Operational Excellence do not consider the ability to change in their assessments.

Issue reports are the earliest documents available for the correction of a software. We tackle effort estimation in early stages of agile software development as text classification of issue reports. This task consists of assigning categories to such documents, often written in natural language and programming code. Typically, text classification is performed with feature extraction techniques that produce informative features for a text classifier. Autoencoders generate input representations in increasing levels of abstraction, which may represent meaningful semantics in issue reports. We propose a study on the effectiveness of autoencoders for estimating the effort required for the agile correction of software functionalities in the context of real-world open-source projects. Our experiments provided significant evidences that autoencoders are able to encode noisy documents and provide informative features to a text classifier and improve its generalization.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6014-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489030","","Software;Estimation;Feature extraction;Agile software development;Natural languages;Planning;Task analysis","feature extraction;natural language processing;pattern classification;software prototyping;text analysis","text classifier;effort estimation;text classification;autoencoders;software development methodologies;high-quality products;time frame;budget;agile software development;software correction;natural language;programming code;open-source projects;noisy documents;informative features extraction","","5","","38","","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This framework provides appropriate information for managers and decision makers and facilitates project planning (scheduling and budgeting) by incorporating uncertainties and risks. To visualize the risk, this article uses an extended version of the integrated definition standard as the example business process. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed SRAF under varied dynamic conditions, we have considered and solved a practical case study using a self-developed heuristic approach, titled enhanced move-based local search heuristic.

While successful to some extent, a significant number of cases have been documented where the methods failed to generate lasting improvement, or resulted in problems of a different nature. Based on Lean case studies, the cause of failure is likely the lack of a holistic view of the context of software development prior to applying either Agile or Lean methods. The current study applies the system dynamics framework in generating this perspective. This allowed for the software development process to be mapped as a collection of feedback loops. From doing so, it was found that developers tended to neglect key support activities under backlog pressure, which made the actual development processes less efficient. Based on the system structure, it is recommended that the causal relationship between the support activities and actual development be made explicit. This would serve as a feedback mechanism to reinforce practice of the support activities.","","978-1-5386-7767-4","10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666338","agile;lean;software development;system dynamics","Software;System dynamics;Tools;Productivity;Adaptation models","DP industry;software prototyping","system dynamics framework;software development process;Lean software development methods;software industry;agile software development methods","","3","","25","","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, to determine which action should be taken is not an easy task, since project managers have to analyze the context of the deviation event and search for actions that were successfully taken on previous similar contexts, trying to repeat the effectiveness of these actions. To do so, usually managers use previous projects data or their own experience, and frequently there is no measure or similarity criteria formally established. Thus, in this paper we present the results of a survey that aimed to identify characteristics that can determine the similarity among software projects and also a measure to indicate the level of similarity among them. A recommendation system to support the execution of corrective actions based on previous projects is also described. We believe these results can support the improvement of software project monitoring process, providing important knowledge to project managers in order to improve monitoring and control activities on the projects.","","978-1-4244-8539-0","10.1109/QUATIC.2010.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655652","software project similarity;software project monitoring process;similarity measure;recommendation system","Monitoring;Software;Digital signal processing;Context;Software measurement;Weight measurement;Organizations","project management;recommender systems;software process improvement","software project control;recommendation system;software project monitoring process improvement","","3","","22","","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially in fast-feedback agile teams, software testers must respond to their teammates' need for information with readily available, easy-to-understand testing materials. The novel twist of turning user experience personas inward to focus on the product team members provides deep insights into both what decisions team members need to make and how to present testing information to them to support those decisions. Having established personas as the context for the testing work, testers are poised to spring into action, planning, estimating, and executing both exploratory testing and user-facing automation. Testers then surface the results of this work to the product team in a way that helps them to address concerns in a timely fashion. Big visible charts display testing for co-located teams in a particularly effective form. Testers experiment with a variety of big visible representations throughout the life of the team, retaining these charts only as long as they provide value for decision-making and moving on to other forms as the team learns more about satisfying their information-gathering needs through testing. User personas produce a fresh perspective on product team members to help testers to focus on the value big visible testing artifacts provide to the individuals on a software development team.","","978-0-7695-5076-3","10.1109/AGILE.2013.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6612884","software testing;agile testing;big visible charts;user personas","Testing;Business;Context;Usability;Automation;Computer bugs","decision making;program testing;software engineering","big visible testing;software testing;fast-feedback agile teams;user facing automation;exploratory testing;decision-making;software development team","","2","","6","","30 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of this study is to provide a better understanding of practices and challenges when developing academic software engineering MOOCs. To this end, we research (i) how MOOCs in SEE are designed and (ii) what learning design considerations educators and learning designers have when developing SEE-related MOOCs. To address the first research question, a systematic mapping is performed to outline the current landscape. The second research question is answered by analyzing and reflecting on practical experiences acquired during the design of a MOOC on Agile Software Development. The design of the course was based on the Pedagogical Design Pattern Framework for MOOCs, an approach to design for learning that was defined in our previous studies. For this course, two environments were considered: (a) course-time on the Tim Tec MOOC platform for deeper engagement with active learning activities, such as Project-based learning; (b) a Facebook group as a social and collaborative learning space, including scenarios based on problem-based learning to activate prior knowledge. Some of the pedagogical strategies adopted to motivate self-regulated learning included self-introduction video, diary, diagnostic self-assessments, development of small projects alone and in pairs. Our findings provide evidence that there are still several technological and pedagogical challenges that need to be addressed so as to enhance the MOOCs learning experience for SEE. Technological issues identified include the development of tools and educational games, which should be integrated into MOOCs, and the use of learning analytics to support motivation, user experience, and more active learning in specific topics, such as Project Management, Agile Methods, and Requirements Engineering. In turn, the most significant and needed improvement to the pedagogical aspects is a re-thinking of the virtual moment in the MOOC platform so as to optimize it through activities that promote active learning and contextualized assessments.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190588","MOOCs;Software Engineering Education;Agile Software Development;Lifelong Learning;Learning Design;Design Patterns","Software engineering;Software;Education;Agile software development;Collaboration;Tools;Computer science","computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science education;educational courses;groupware;social networking (online);software engineering","massive open online courses;software engineering education;Agile Software Development;Pedagogical Design Pattern Framework;Tim Tec MOOC platform;social learning space;collaborative learning space;educational games;Requirements Engineering;active learning;self-regulated learning;academic software engineering MOOC;SEE-related MOOC;self-introduction video","","2","","21","","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ASD promises customer feedback, quick iterations, onsite customer relationship and also accommodates changes even after development. On the other hand, software reuse helps the organizations to deal with software complexity by systematic reuse, fast response to customers' expectations and demands, reduced time to market, and increased productivity and quality. We believe that introduction of systematic reusability in ASD will improve the development process and it will be beneficial for organizations in achieving their short term and long term goals. Although few approaches have been proposed to address this issue but the scope of those studies is limited. In this work, we therefore, have proposed an approach to extend the most used agile method scrum to introduce the concept of systematic reusability. To support our idea and for the validation purpose, we have conducted control experiments. Experiment results prove overall performance of proposed approach.","","978-1-7281-4970-7","10.1109/iCoMET48670.2020.9074066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9074066","Software Reuse;Agile Software Development;Reusability","Organizations;Systematics;Variable speed drives;Planning;Agriculture;Software reusability","project management;software development management;software prototyping;software reusability","organizations;software complexity;systematic reuse;customers;increased productivity;systematic reusability;ASD;long term goals;agile method scrum;agile software development;software reusability;software engineering;customer feedback;quick iterations;onsite customer relationship;software reuse","","","","20","","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hybrid optoelectronic packet routers which combine optical switching fabric and electronic buffers are used, supporting 100 Gbit/s (25 Gbit/s × 4 wavelengths) optical packets. OCS transmission is implemented by a novel “express path,” (ExP) an instant wavelength path on demand, which enables certain flows following the ExP with no packet contention, whereas ordinary OPS packets are switched with a deflection routing algorithm and buffering for contention resolution. This architecture can support OCS for large and reliability-sensitive data transferring and OPS for latency-sensitive applications. The performance of the network is investigated via numerical simulations of top-of-rack switch (ToR)-to-ToR traffic in an N-dimensional (up to 4096 node) torus topology. We have made the following observations: 1) torus topology results in high throughput and can be scaled out by increasing the dimension; 2) contention resolution between OPS and agile OCS is needed and our proposed strategies enhance the overall performance; and 3) in a lightly to moderately loaded case of OPS traffic, more than 100 ExPs can be supported simultaneously with acceptable affect on OPS.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.7.001109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7367909","Contention resolution;Data center network;Flow management;Optical packet switching;Optical circuit switching","Optical switches;Optical buffering;Optical packet switching;Routing;Switching circuits;High-speed optical techniques;Optical amplifiers","computer centres;integrated optoelectronics;numerical analysis;optical communication equipment;optical switches;packet switching;telecommunication network routing","OPS-agile-OCS data center network;flow management;performance analysis;DCN;optical packet switching;agile optical circuit switching;hybrid optoelectronic packet routers;combine optical switching fabric;electronic buffers;OCS transmission;express path;instant wavelength path on demand;ordinary OPS packets;deflection routing algorithm;buffering;contention resolution;latency-sensitive applications;numerical simulations;top-of-rack switch-to-ToR traffic;N-dimensional torus topology;agile OCS;bit rate 100 Gbit/s","","4","","","","29 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the basic Scrum framework has proven itself to be too strict for Data Science, due to frequent unpredictabilities of Data Science tasks. Consequently, adaptions were made to traditional Scrum to make it more suitable for the new challenges. This article discusses further adaptations and suggests that Scrum in itself is usable in Data Science, however, additional adaptations of the core concepts need to be envisioned.","","978-1-6654-7938-7","10.1109/ICBDA55095.2022.9760341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9760341","SCRUM;data science;project management","Data science;Big Data;Task analysis;Scrum (Software development);Software engineering","project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping","Data Science tasks;basic Scrum framework;agile project methodologies;Data Science teams;Data Science projects;traditional Scrum","","","","43","IEEE","21 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This phenomenon is clearly a problem of a poor software quality strategy applied on the software project development process. Despite there are some software quality assurance set of tools and approaches like quality models, quality frameworks and so on, these are incapable to be implemented as quick as needed by a small team of developers.

The model was informed by semistructured interviews with senior executives from engineering, information technology (IT) services and technical consulting firms. As a result, we capture many of the complexities associated with the resource planning process in the professional engineering services sector. In the resulting model, the key attributes of supply, demand, and operations constraints are identified. Based on information obtained from the interviews, a number of test firms are created. We then use these test firms to study the impact of various resource planning policies on firm performance. These policies include the skill mix and profile of skilled employees, limits on the number of concurrent projects to which an employee can be assigned, and policies governing employee cross-training and hiring. The impact of these policies is evaluated in terms of business metrics, such as the project completion rate and net revenue. Finally, our model is extended to capture a multiphase rolling planning horizon, where projects may span multiple phases with the goal of ensuring consistency in employee assignment to projects.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2015.2457675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7214259","Linear optimization;management of scientists and engineers;project scheduling;resource allocation systems;resource management;Linear optimization;management of scientists and engineers;project scheduling;resource allocation systems;resource management","Planning;Interviews;Labor resources;Resource management;Human resource management","customer satisfaction;customer services;organisational aspects;personnel;project management;resource allocation;supply and demand;training","multiphase rolling planning horizon;business metrics;net revenue;project completion rate;employee cross-training;hiring;firm performance;operations constraints;professional engineering services sector;semistructured interviews;senior executives;information technology services;technical consulting firms;customer demand;skilled engineers;resource planning policies;engineering services firms;supply and demand","","10","","46","IEEE","20 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many innovation projects fail due to late clarification of technical feasibility. Especially high-tech projects require innovative solutions to meet the restrictions of cost and schedule while still delivering high performance critical systems. Since Scrum does not have any software-specific content, it can also be used in other development areas such as hardware development. However, there are currently only isolated scientific reports that show the successful use of Scrum in hardware development. In order to investigate the potential of Scrum in hardware development, the agile approach is applied for the development of an exoskeleton at a large corporate within automotive industry (OEM).

One of the most popular agile methods is Scrum, which is a methodology that involves an iterative, incremental and empirical process. In addition, it is designed to add value, focus, clarity, and transparency to the activities and products of a project. Agile methods have been criticized and defended, and research has shown that accommodating change can be a factor in both success and failure. Although Scrum is a light and easy to understand process, its adoption is sometimes difficult. To gather a set of factors to identify success during a Sprint implementation, a systematic review of the literature is carried out in which we find several factors that help to achieve the success of a Sprint; these are classified into four groups: personnel, project, product, and organization. The results represent a basis for companies seeking to improve the implementation of Scrum.","","978-1-7281-2524-4","10.1109/CONISOFT.2019.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9105491","component;Scrum;Scrum management;Sprint;Sprint management;success;systematic literature review;software development","","project management;public domain software;software development management;software prototyping;software quality","agile methods;empirical process;software products;high-quality software;software professionals;agile-based software development;systematic literature review;Scrum project delivery","","2","","50","","2 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article reports on two very different experiences in two academic years. In the first year, agile SCRUM methodology, groups of five students, three interactions and a final project were used. In the second year, the Project based Learning was used with groups of three students for two different products, changing the composition of the groups. In both cases, peer classification was used. The results show that in the first case there is an increase in the approval rate, while in the second case there is an increase in the dropout rate.

In Scrum, the most popular agile method, process improvement is implemented through regular Retrospective meetings. In these meetings, team members reflect on the latest development iteration and decide on improvement actions. To identify potential issues, data on the completed iteration needs to be gathered. The Scrum method itself does not prescribe these steps in detail. However, Retrospective games, i.e. interactive group activities, have been proposed to encourage the sharing of experiences and problems. These activities mostly rely on the collected perceptions of team members. However, modern software development practices produce a large variety of digital project artifacts, e.g. commits in version control systems or test run results, which contain detailed information on performed teamwork. We propose taking advantage of this information in new, data-driven Retrospective activities, allowing teams to gain additional insights based on their own team-specific data.","2574-1926","978-1-4503-7122-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9270343","Retrospective;Agile;Software Repository Mining","Software;Software engineering;Data mining;Presses;Games;Conferences;Writing","iterative methods;project management;software development management;software prototyping;team working","scrum method;interactive group activities;software development practices;team-specific data;project data;agile software development methods;iterative work;scrum retrospectives;process improvement cycles;data-driven retrospective activities","","","","36","","1 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the construction industry is constantly searching for management models that can minimize the previously mentioned inconveniences in order to differentiate themselves and take advantage of their competitors. Precisely, the Scrum framework, conceived in the software engineering industry, is an alternative to traditional projects management, offering an exponential improvement in communication for project teams and improving the planning of activities, through an iterative framework that allows flexibility for changing requirements, reduces uncertainty and creates reliability for what was planned.

However, with limited observation sensor resources for a multiparameter observation task, the spatial misalignment of the coverage area of each parameter decreases the observation efficiency, especially in a space-ground sensor network. To solve this problem, we developed a collaborative planning method in the sensor planning phase. With this method, a space-ground maximal coverage model with multiple parameters (SGMC-MP) was introduced. The proposed collaborative planning method cooperatively utilizes the space-ground sensors to make an observation plan. This method aims to maximize the overlay coverage range among the parameters in the task to reduce the spatial misalignment and improve the utilization of the sensors.

At the heart of this capability is a robust and adaptive tactical network that facilitates mission command at every echelon. Though the Army possess a strong network, continuing efforts to improve it over time is a struggle. Cost and schedule overruns have become normal occurrences as individual systems fail to pass the Army's rigorous interoperability certification requirements. Without interoperability, the network does not work. The Army's acquisition community's shift to focus on a new paradigm of network development, the Common Operating Environment (COE), promised to create a better system for insuring network interoperability in a timely manner. Old habits and practices, however, have threatened the promise of the new paradigm in terms of development, evaluation, and certification. This document examines current practices and issues regarding network development and makes a recommendation for how to approach COE to achieve greater levels of interoperability faster and cheaper. By utilizing an agile based approach, COE can be developed as a system of systems through iterative sprints that focus on developing an interconnected network that works the first time.","","978-1-4673-9519-9","10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490620","System of Systems;Systems of Systems Testing and Evaluation;Scrum of Scrums;Common Operating Environment","Interoperability;Testing;System of systems;Software;Certification;Steady-state;Force","military communication;military computing;open systems;software prototyping;systems engineering","testing plan;development plan;army common operating environment;US Army;adaptive tactical network;robust tactical network;army interoperability certification requirements;army acquisition community shift;common operating environment;COE;interconnected network;army network acquisition;agile systems of systems development","","","","15","","16 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, research on how these frameworks are adopted in practice is seriously lacking. In this paper we describe how Comptel, a globally distributed software development company, adopted the SAFe framework in two business lines. Based on eleven interviews we present why and how the organization adopted SAFe, and discuss related challenges and success factors. The comparison of the two adoptions showed that investing in SAFe trainings, engaging people and change agents, hiring a coach, investing in a full-time release train engineer, preparing well for the first planning event and continuously improving and customizing SAFe led to good results.","","978-1-5386-1587-4","10.1109/ICGSE.2017.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976685","Scaled agile framework;agile adoption;global software development","Planning;Companies;Software;Training;Interviews","software houses;software prototyping","SAFe;globally distributed organization;software development organizations;scaled agile framework;large-scale scrum;disciplined agile delivery;DAD;LeSS;Comptel;globally distributed software development company;business lines;success factors;SAFe trainings;coach hiring;full-time release train engineer;first planning event;SAFe customization;agile methods","","48","","14","","17 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ideally, the foundational principles should be learned together with the Scrum practices, but often teams learn the practices without the principles. We have successfully taught Scrum practices and principles together in a graduate course in software engineering, and found students were able to execute Scrum effectively.

This has led to the rise of new paradigms, where concepts such as, “plug and produce”, modularity and agent technology are applied. Among them highlights Evolvable Assembly Systems (EAS) which proposes an agile solution by considering a “plug and produce” environment. This approach presents a number of opportunities and challenges. One of these is the allocation of assembly capabilities to process requirements. This arises due to the separation of product driven requirements from the implementation process, into capabilities that embed the concepts of modularity and “plug and produce”. Users tend to define assembly process requirements at a high level, with the objective to be equipment independent, while equipment specific processes are normally defined at the lowest-level of granularity to be applied in different assembly workflows. The more specific a user defines production requirements the more limited is the number of solutions that can be offered by a particular assembly system, hence, the tendency to define production requirements at high level. This presents an important problem, the need to bridge the gap between assembly process requirements definition with the lower-level capabilities provided by equipment in a particular assembly system. This scenario is the motivation of this work, and the definition of a methodology that takes into consideration different levels of process requirements definitions, and the allocation of lower level skills (capabilities) which are equipment specific using skill-based patterns to provide feasible assembly processes solutions.","2378-363X","978-1-4799-4905-2","10.1109/INDIN.2014.6945569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945569","Assembly;Configuration;Skill;Pattern;Matching;Plug & Produce;Evolvable;Mechatronic;Industrial Agent","Assembly;Resource management;Assembly systems;Pattern matching;Mechatronics;Plugs;Complexity theory","agile manufacturing;assembling;product quality;production engineering computing","multilevel skill-based allocation methodology;evolvable assembly systems;manufacturing systems;high-quality products;agent technology;EAS;agile solution;plug and produce environment;assembly capabilities;product driven requirements;assembly process requirements;assembly workflows;production requirements;skill-based patterns;assembly processes solutions","","5","","24","","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High technology projects require innovative solutions to meet the restrictions of cost and schedule and still deliver high performance critical systems. This paper addresses the application of the flexible style of agile systems engineering for dynamic, complex hardware and software projects. These projects can benefit from applying the principles of agile systems engineering as has been demonstrated in the software realm. Fundamental to the rapid development is understanding the role of innovation and momentum in agile project management and systems engineering. For post industrial age projects that require non proven concepts, large degrees of uncertainty and ambiguity and extensive non-recurring engineering, agile systems engineering allows for project development with continuous change while addressing risk. Agile systems engineering exploits the role of momentum to allow innovation in the development process while allowing risk interactions to be managed in a disciplined manner. Examples of how these concepts were used on the design and development of two small satellites at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) in the Multi-Mission Bus Demonstrator (MMBD) project. This challenging satellite build did not use existing key technology (heritage hardware) and created a large paradigm shift from traditional satellite development. Rapid design and development, a “momentum play”, was used to continuously allow change and assessment in a hardware adaptation of the SCRUM technique seen in Extreme Programming. The MMBD project demonstrates the adaptation of these agile concepts. By freezing late in the design cycle, the MMBD project was able to insert innovations throughout the program cycle. The ability to be innovative related to the speed with which the development progressed, including working quickly through all technology choices. This paper discusses agile systems engineering as applied to both software and hardware. Short of papers on embedded systems using agile systems engineering, there are too few projects demonstrating these adaptations of techniques to complex, innovative hardware projects. The Multi-Mission Bus Demonstrator is an excellent benchmark example of program management of rapid technology maturity in a high technology application. This paper demonstrates how agile systems engineering techniques can be adapted to a high technology development program and shows how project momentum was critical to separate the constant non-recurring technology challenges to be worked rapidly from the engineering risk liens requiring longer time frames to retire.","1095-323X","978-1-4577-0557-1","10.1109/AERO.2012.6187425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187425","","Hardware;Satellites;Systems engineering and theory;NASA;Space vehicles;Satellite broadcasting;Educational institutions","aerospace computing;project management;software engineering;systems engineering","agile hardware;software system engineering;innovation;agile system engineering;agile project management;satellite development;MMBD project;multimission bus demonstrator;high technology development program;project momentum","","20","","18","","19 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper defines a set of heuristics and its graphical representation for using a multi-model catalogue for software project management. The objective is to homologate best practices of both agile and traditional frameworks in a multi-model environment, using a pilot validation of the proposal for the requirement management process in SCRUM and CMMI-DEV 1.3.

While documentation can be changed, the documentation changes after sprint planning may invalidate the estimated effort and sprint plan. Hence, to help the team be aware of the potential documentation changes, we developed DocWarn to estimate the probability that a work item will have documentation changes. We developed three variations of DocWarn, which are based on the characteristics extracted from the work items (DocWarn-C), the natural language text (DocWarn-T), and both inputs (DocWarn-H). Based on nine open-source projects that work in sprints and actively maintain documentation, DocWarn can predict the documentation changes with an average AUC of 0.75 and an average F1-Score of 0.36, which are significantly higher than the baselines. We also found that the most influential characteristics of a work item for determining the future documentation changes are the past tendency of the developers and the length of description text. Based on the qualitative assessment, we found that 40%-68% of the correctly predicted documentation changes were related to scope modification. With the prediction of DocWarn, the team will be better aware of the potential documentation changes during sprint planning, allowing the team to manage the uncertainty and reduce the risk of unreliable effort estimation and sprint planning.","2574-3864","978-1-4503-9303-4","10.1145/3524842.3528445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796335","agile;documentation;iteration planning;sprint planning;effort estimation;document;change","Uncertainty;Natural languages;Estimation;Documentation;Planning;Iterative methods;Reliability","","","","","","62","","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developing economies are in dear need of UCD; low IT literacy, low infrastructure and funds; and heterogeneity in culture and livelihood result in special requirements on usability in order to harvest the possible benefits of IT. Traditional UCD methods, however, are often regarded as heavy-weight and expensive. Agile software development methods are light-weight, flexible and iterative in order to accommodate the changing requirements and unsure funding and are therefore important for IT companies in developing economies. Can we adjust UCD methods to fit the need of developing economies and with agile development while taking advantage of the iterative character of agile development methods? The research appropriated an action research approach called Cooperative Method Development (CMD). Based on the empirical investigation, UCD challenges were identified, innovative use of light-weight UCD methods was deliberated and implemented. The improvements include: working with local IT personnel, light-weight and incremental use of personas, support departments performing acceptance testing on release versions, culturally adapted user testing in pairs and heuristic evaluation as adapted UCD practices. The evaluation together with the involved practitioners shows improvements in the development process including reduced reworks; satisfied users; better collaboration with stakeholders; and a close understanding of users and their needs. The evaluation of the resulting integrated approach with the involved practitioners as well as software engineers not involved in the research indicates that the results are transferable to similar contexts.","","978-1-4503-5719-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8596350","Lightweight UCD;Agile Development;discount usability methods;personas;heuristic evaluation;user-pair test","Usability;Organizations;Cultural differences;Software engineering;Agile software development;Stakeholders","human computer interaction;interactive systems;software prototyping;user centred design;user interfaces","lightweight user-centered design;user experience;agile software development methods;user testing;economies;UCD methods;scrum-based development process;IT literacy;cooperative method development","","","","27","","30 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method used Scrumban Board to distinguish the responsible team or personal and what to be done in the project. The role of team members same as Scrum, but in this proposed method, we add UI owner as responsible UI/UX designer. The UI Owner will evaluate the UI design to Stakeholder with Project Owner. The System will be further tested using System Usability Scale.

We describe and discuss a globally distributed agile project at DNV GL Software, a multinational provider of software for a safer, smarter and greener future in the energy, process and maritime industries. DNV GL Software is headquartered in Norway. The project is distributed across two locations with 12 team members in Norway and three testers in China. In a distributed agile team with little overlap in working hours the challenge is to coordinate tasks and test activities in a way that makes coordination and communication efficient. DNV GL Software believes in including the remote testers as part of the agile team, enabling self-managing, cross-functional virtual teams that are capable of taking the full responsibility for implementing and verifying one entire feature. To support the communication between testers in China and the rest of the team in Norway, the team needs a shared understanding of the goal of a release and how to collaborate. We conducted interviews with the team and representatives from different roles in the organization, and we performed retrospectives with the team. In this article we describe how continuous testing based on continuous and frequent feedback ensures knowledge sharing and safeguarding the quality of the system under development. We found the following enablers for a successful virtual agile team: coordination by mutual adjustment, dedicated testers and low turnover, shifting working hours, and self-management and autonomy. Non-technical factors, such as socio-technical and organizational factors, have a significant influence on the way software testing is performed in an agile virtual team. To be successful the organization needs to invest in bringing the remote testers closer to the rest of the team, as part of the virtual team.","2329-6313","978-1-4799-8409-1","10.1109/ICGSE.2015.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7224491","testing;test centers;agile;virtual teams;distributed agile","Software;Virtual groups;Software testing;Computer bugs;Context;Documentation","program testing;project management;software prototyping","continuous software testing;mutual adjustment;virtual agile team;system quality safeguarding;knowledge sharing;remote tester;DNV GL Software;globally distributed agile software project","","15","","7","","3 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software change control (SCC) as a subset of software quality assurance (SQA) is responsible for examining, approving changes, assuring quality of changes made and quality of the newer version of system with changes implemented. While a system is often broken down into a number of releases, these SCC tasks can be fulfilled by integrating approved changes to planned releases. As such, SCC tasks can be achieved simultaneously with project releases. However, a number of relevant discussions are focusing on the process of handling change request as a cycle itself and neglected the integration of changes to project. The overall view of IT project activities and sequence is not readily presented has too lead to the blurred vision of how changes can be integrated. This paper then addresses two main areas. One on establishing the association between project life cycle (PLC) and system development lifecycle (SDLC) to present an overall picture of IT project activities since changes can impact any area of a project and eventually integrate in it; and the other is on the integration between IT project and change requests that can achieve SCC concurrently considering the project throughput as a whole.","","978-1-7281-1826-0","10.1109/ICSPC47137.2019.9067982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9067982","software change control;change management;IT project management;software quality assurance (SQA)","Planning;Project management;Maintenance engineering;Training;Software;Task analysis;Monitoring","management of change;software development management;software maintenance;software quality","SCC tasks;project releases;change request;IT project activities;project life cycle;practical implication;software quality assurance;change control management;project activities matters;software change control;approved changes;planned releases","","2","","27","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is developed as a social innovation which aims to combat the limitations of current systems utilized by clubs, whereby there is no central repository for information, and each club utilizes their own methods for management, member communication, and event organization. A greater attention had been considered to Kanban as an agile software development method in developing such a management system. However, the adoption of this methodology is quite challenging to incorporate user experience and usability in an agile process. Hence, this study utilized the Kanban approach which is an implementation of Lean methodology to manage the software life cycle in developing a university club management system. The user requirements have been identified and documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) along with the use case diagram and entity relationship diagram for the database definition. The software was developed using the Laravel PHP Framework. Functional testing and usability testing have been carried out to validate the user requirement. The result of usability testing shows that the system satisfies five usability factors. This will spark some new insights in the use of its technologies and methods for future research.","","978-1-7281-4928-8","10.1109/ICIDM51048.2020.9339668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9339668","club management system;kanban;usability","Technological innovation;Systematics;Software;User experience;Sparks;Usability;Testing","entity-relationship modelling;formal specification;health care;Internet;kanban;mobile computing;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;user interfaces","usability testing;Kanban agile process;centralized management;agile software development method;incorporate user experience;university club management system;user requirement;Software Requirements Specification","","","","15","","4 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It focuses on process and project improvement in different fields and emphasizes a team's ability to improve the efficiency of day-to-day activities by implementing the core practices (e.g., visualizing workflow, limiting work-in-progress, managing flow). The efficiency of day-to-day activities is crucial in every process, yet, recent times have called for a new out-of-the-box approach to address the challenges companies face. While the literature review presents efficiency improvements through the use of the core practices, one of the biggest problems while implementing Kanban is shown to be the setting of effective work-in-progress limits. This article addresses this issue and proves that the workflow does not exclusively depend on the work-in-progress limits—as the core practices suggest—but on determining the optimal relationship (solution) among the replenishment value, resource capacity, and work-in-progress limits. Such an approach ensures that the workflow pace on the Kanban board is sustainable by reducing the number of work items in queues as well as people's idleness. The proposed empirical approach runs a series of simulation scenarios aimed at helping to identify the optimal relationship among the three mentioned elements for generating a sustainable workflow pace and minimizing work/people's idleness.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3120984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611021","Agile project management;Kanban method;replenishment;resource capacity;work-in-progress (WIP) limits","Task analysis;Software;Project management;Visualization;Standards;Feedback loop;Continuous improvement","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Project management is an approach based on the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities aimed at fulfilling the expectations of the parties involved in the project. The main phases of a project are initiation phase, design phase, execution phase, and closure phase. Project management methodologies enable a project to succeed and comply with the deadlines, budget and resources provided, including classic methods, agile methods, adaptive methods, critical path method, and lean management method. A wide range of tools is available for the management of a project. Gantt diagrams are an effective and practical tool for project management.

Software Project Management (SPM) plays a key role in the success of GSD. As a result, the need has arisen to study and evaluate the downsides of SPM for GSD, to thereby pave the way for the development of new methods, techniques, and tools with which to tackle them. This paper aims to identify and classify research on SPM approaches for GSD that are available in the literature, to identify their current weaknesses and strengths, and to analyze their applications in industry. We performed a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) based on six classification criteria. Eighty-four papers were selected and analyzed. The results indicate that interest in SPM for GSD has been increasing since 2006. As a class of approaches, the most frequently reported methods (40%) are those used for coordination, planning, and monitoring, along with estimation techniques that can be used to better match a distributed project. SPM for GSD requires further investigation by researchers and practitioners, particularly with respect to cost and time estimations. These findings will help overcome the challenges that must to be considered in future SPM research for GSD, especially regarding collaboration and time-zone differences.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8484934","Software Project Management (SPM);Global Software Development (GSD);SPM approaches;Systematic Mapping Study (SMS)","Software;Project management;Standards;Planning;Systematics;Software engineering;Monitoring","formal specification;software development management;software engineering;software management","software project management;software engineering;global software development;systematic mapping study;SPM approaches;GSD","","5","","","","14 Oct 2018","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

We used a survey questionnaire and open discussion with ten software practitioners, from two ASD companies to validate the Agile QR-Doc. The practitioners evaluated the guidelines in terms of usefulness, relevance, understandability, and coverage of important aspects for supporting QR documentation and their impact on the agility of the software development process. Agile QR-Doc list 12 recommendations that are grouped into two categories. The first category introduces three recommendations that focus on raising awareness about the significance of QRs, their documentation and related challenges. The second category lists nine recommendations that introduce artifacts, practices and important aspects for documenting QRs. The validation reveals the relevance, understandability and usefulness of the guidelines to support QR documentation in ASD. It also indicates that the guidelines consider important aspects for documenting QRs and that they do not negatively affect the agility of the software development process.

The arguments for this research are based on the practical understanding of the authors that no single ‘type’ of process appears to be suitable for software development projects. Increasingly, there appears to be a need to use high-ceremony ‘waterfall’ type approaches at the programme and project management level, whereas at individual level, ‘agile’ aspects of a process seem to help. The dichotomy between extensive modeling of the high-ceremony approach and the practically nil modeling of the low-ceremony ‘agile’ approach needs to be studied, understood and incorporated in a process. A composite process framework has the potential for accepting this responsibility of balancing the modeling with software projects, as is argued in this paper.","","978-0-7695-3099-4","10.1109/ITNG.2008.108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4492694","Software Development Process;Composite process;Modeling in Software;Waterfall;Iterative;Agile approach","Application software;Software development management;Project management;Programming;Prototypes;Documentation;Iterative methods;Software systems;Risk management;Feedback","formal verification;project management;software development management","composite application software development process framework;CASDPF;formal modeling;formal management;project management;software application systems;agile methods;spiral life-cycle model","","","","5","","18 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We improve the efficiency of this algorithm by introducing a multi-processing scheme for estimating value function in its backward pass. This pass has been often calculated as a single process. This parallel SLQ algorithm can optimize longer time horizons without proportional increase in its computation time. Thus, our MPC algorithm can generate optimized trajectories for the next few phases of the motion within only a few milliseconds. This outperforms the state of the art by at least one order of magnitude. The performance of the approach is validated on a quadruped robot for generating dynamic gaits such as trotting.","2164-0580","978-1-5386-4678-6","10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2017.8246930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8246930","","Heuristic algorithms;Mathematical model;Trajectory;Planning;Legged locomotion;Robot kinematics","legged locomotion;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;path planning;predictive control;robot dynamics","legged robots;nonlinear Model Predictive Control;constrained optimal control algorithm;multiprocessing scheme;backward pass;parallel SLQ algorithm;MPC algorithm;quadruped robot;real-time motion planning;model predictive control;value function estimation;dynamic gait generation","","43","","22","","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Scrum Team consists of a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and developers. The Scrum Master role is vital in the team. However, looking at the industry, companies have difficulties both in hiring good Scrum Masters, and in convincing their developers or other personnel to take that role. Agile trainers do offer short Scrum Master training courses. However, we lack information on how to train Scrum Masters in university education. In this paper, we report how we arranged a one semester long Scrum Master training course. During the course, students worked as Scrum Masters under the guidance of professional agile coaches and collaborated in a Scrum Master Community of Practice. We collected data by conducting 13 post-course semi-structured interviews with Scrum Masters, and by analyzing the learning diaries of 37 students from three course instances. Team-specific Agile coaches supported their Scrum Master first by example, then by observing the Scrum Masters in action and providing feedback and ideas, and finally by helping the students to reflect. Students found the coaches extremely useful, and wished they had utilized them more. The Scrum Master community of practice worked best when students self-organized, shared practices and tools, and provided peer support when facing problems. Finally, students non-technical backgrounds, as well as female students performed better as Scrum Masters than computer science and male students.","","978-1-6654-0138-8","10.1109/ICSE-SEET52601.2021.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402174","software engineering education;capstone course;Scrum","Training;Tools;Software;Personnel;Scrum (Software development);Interviews;Software engineering","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;personnel;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;teaching;team working;training","professional agile coaches;Scrum Master role;good Scrum Masters;short Scrum Master training courses;semester long Scrum Master training course;Scrum Master Community;Scrum Master community","","","","24","","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The challenge is that estimated software requirements is the only size information available at this stage, compounded with the newly increasing adoption of agile processes in the US DoD. Aims: The objectives are to improve cost estimation by investigating available sizing measures, and providing practical effort estimation models for agile software development projects during the contract bidding phase or earlier. Method: The analysis explores the effects of independent variables for product size, peak staff, and domain on effort. The empirical data for model calibration is from 20 industrial projects completed recently for the US DoD, among a larger dataset of recent projects using other lifecycle processes. Results: Statistical results showed that initial software requirements is a valid size metric for estimating agile software development effort. Prediction accuracy improves when peak staff and domain are added as inputs to the cost models. Conclusion: These models may be used for estimates of agile projects, and evaluating software development contract cost proposals with inputs available during the bidding phase or earlier.","","978-1-5090-4039-1","10.1109/ESEM.2017.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8170082","agile software processes;software cost estimation;software effort;software size;software requirements;requirements volatility;peak staff;domain;productivity;interfaces","Software;US Department of Defense;Estimation;Complexity theory;Contracts;Size measurement","contracts;costing;military computing;project management;software cost estimation;software engineering","early phase cost models;software effort estimates;sizing measures;software development contract cost proposals;agile software development effort;peak staff;product size;agile software development projects;cost estimation;agile processes;estimated software requirements;competitive bidder;government context;decision makers;US DoD;agile software processes","","5","","38","","11 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agility is the only way we will be able to keep up with this change. But there are subtleties that must be considered as we adopt various agile methods: secure, protect, control and authenticate are all elements needed to posture our Information Technology systems to counteract the real and perceived threats in today's environment. Many systems have been tasked to ingest process and analyze different data sets than they were originally designed for and they have to interact with multiple new systems that were unaccounted for at design time. Leveraging the tenets of security, we have devised a new framework that takes agility into a new realm where the product will built to work in a service-based environment but is developed using agile processes. Even though these two criteria promise to hone the development effort, they actually contradict each other in philosophy where Services require stable interfaces, while Agile focuses on being flexible and tolerate changes up to much later stages of development. This framework is focused on enabling a successful product development that capitalizes on both philosophies.","2155-7586","978-1-4673-0081-0","10.1109/MILCOM.2011.6127525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6127525","","Standards;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Documentation;US Department of Defense","information systems;military computing;service-oriented architecture;software prototyping;user interfaces","corporate services development;agile environment;DoD;mission requirements;information systems;service based environment;agile processes;stable interfaces","","3","","12","","12 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key issue is the trade-off between upfront planning and flexibility to embrace change. In particular, the coordination of interfaces is an important challenge, as interfaces determine and regulate the exchange of information between components, subsystems, and systems, which are often developed by multiple teams. In a fast-changing environment, boundary objects between teams can provide the sufficient stability to align software or systems, while maintaining a sufficient degree of autonomy. However, a better understanding of interfaces as boundary objects is needed to give practical guidance. This paper presents an exploratory case study with an automotive OEM to identify characteristics of different interfaces, from non-critical interfaces that can be changed frequently and quickly, to those that are critical and require more stability and a rigorous change process. We identify what dimensions impact how interfaces are changed, what categories of interfaces exist along these dimensions, and how categories of interfaces change over time. We conclude with suggestions for practices to manage the different categories of interfaces in large-scale agile development.","","978-1-7281-0528-4","10.1109/ICSA.2019.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8703906","large-scale agile development;agile architecture;interfaces;boundary objects;case study;architectural change;automotive;empirical software engineering","Computer architecture;Interviews;Software;Automotive engineering;Companies;Stability analysis;Safety","automotive engineering;organisational aspects;project management;safety-critical software;software architecture;software development management;software prototyping;user interfaces","upfront planning;large-scale agile development;noncritical interfaces;automotive OEM;align software;sufficient stability;boundary objects;large-scale agile contexts;safety-critical systems;agile architecting","","3","","22","","2 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To find out, this study examines agile leadership from the perspective of thirteen professionals who identify as agile leaders, in different roles, at ten different software development companies of varying sizes. Data from semi-structured interviews reveals that leadership: (1) is dynamically shared among team members; (2) engenders a sense of belonging to the team; and (3) involves balancing competing organizational cultures (e.g. balancing the new agile culture with the old milestone-driven culture). In other words, agile leadership is a property of a team, not a role, and effectiveness depends on agile team members' identifying with the team, accepting responsibility, and being sensitive to cultural conflict.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-9221-1","10.1145/3510003.3510100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794040","agile methods;leadership;management;culture","Leadership;Companies;Software;Cultural differences;Interviews;Software engineering;Business","","","","","","81","","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The emergence of agile methodologies seems to be the answer to the drastic degree of change in the modern business and IT environments. Agile methodologies have gained popularity due to their ability to cope with unstable requirements throughout the development life cycle, improving communication between developers and customers, and delivering products in shorter time frames, when compared to traditional development methods. These adaptive and flexible methods, relying on a set of best practices that are considered to increase quality, completely redefine quality assurance work, from formal roles to day-to-day activities. The developers, following a set of best practices, such as planning game or sprint planning, test driven development (TDD), refactoring, pair programming, continuous integrations, customer collaboration, etc., create value and assure quality through all the development phases, from requirements to the final release. Many empirical studies support and evangelize the advantages of agile methods and their practices with respect to quality and some of them will be presented in this thematic track.","","978-1-4673-2345-1","10.1109/QUATIC.2012.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6511823","","","","","","","","","","2 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While agile frameworks prescribe ways of doing, in reality these codified practices must adapt to a real workplace. Nowhere is this more plainly seen than in the onboarding stage of new employees: this is the point where newcomers establish an identity and establish means of participating within the development community.We report on the evolving nature of onboarding and mentoring at a mature software development firm that has practiced Scrum for a decade. As the firm has scaled up to an international purveyor of specialized engineering software and services, the way in which new employees are brought into the community of practice has changed profoundly. We view this history through a series of lenses: those of workplace participants entering the firm at different stages of the firm’s history.

By putting the environment and the social issues at the heart of its concerns, the agile organization needs to reinforce these investments by developing the fundamental agile capabilities of the workforce. Thus, workforce agility concept appeared. In a qualitative approach, we focus on the five agile capacities by exploring the practices related to these capabilities.

"Getting things done in academia: the challenges with institutional bureaucracy and the need for project management","A. Goldenstein; E. Wirtz; E. Berger","School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana; School of Engineering Education, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana; School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana","2018 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","7 Mar 2019","2018","","","1","6","This paper presents a case study at a large Midwestern university where agile project management influenced the outcome of change initiatives in an Engineering School (ES). Agile project management encompasses several skills including leadership, communication, organization, conflict management, and the ability to navigate ambiguity. While this skill set is common in many industries, it is very uncommon in higher education. By infusing this diverse way of thinking into transformational efforts aimed at enhancing the student experience, we have disrupted the traditional academic hierarchy, seen greater momentum and greater initial success, and created a new model for “getting things done” in academic organizations.As part of the REvolutionizing engineering and computer science Departments (RED) grant, we aim to improve the culture in the ES. To accomplish this, we have formed grassroots teams consisting of faculty, staff, and students that launch experiments aimed at improving students' professional skills development & departmental culture. This effort has consisted of ~50 participants across 12 teams for three semesters. We did not initially foresee the level of oversight & management needed to run such an effort or the bureaucratic barriers to operationalizing the grassroots teams and experiments. In response to this environment, agile project management was introduced half-way through the first set of experiments. Through observations, surveys, interviews, and outcomes of the experiments themselves, we have characterized the impact of adding agile project management to this program.Our early results indicate that progress can be expedited by an agile project management skill set, and more specifically, the number of experiments launched through grassroots efforts has increased by a factor of 7 semester-over-semester after adding agile project management. Additionally, 92% of participants reported being satisfied with the experience with an average rating of 4 out of 5. Lastly, the value that project managers add was a key theme cited in end-of-semester surveys and interviews. Our early success metrics suggest that this critical industry skill set, generally lacking in academic settings, can make a significant difference in the success of departmental initiatives. We believe that propagating agile project management more broadly in academia can positively influence productivity and expedite the rate of change by re-thinking traditional academic methods of “getting things done”.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658451","project management;re|course;REvolutionizing engineering and computer science Departments (key words)","Project management;Industries;Education;Organizations;Documentation;Interviews;Productivity","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational institutions;engineering education;further education;project management;software prototyping","agile project management skill;institutional bureaucracy;engineering school;ES;higher education;student experience;revolutionizing engineering-computer science department;RED;professional skills development;grassroots efforts;large midwestern university;academic organization","","2","","9","","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These studies allowed us to identify the main trends in the software process for mobile apps, and to uncover the main challenges for app development. We have organized the findings in a framework that integrates the specific challenges of mobile development, which we call Mobile Ilities, with software development activities that are linked through an agile process. The results of early tests carried out with computer science students are encouraging.

On the one hand, there are tools to model the system under construction, i.e. tools for requirements or UML tools for design. On the other hand, there are tools to model the project itself such as project management tools, bug trackers, or tools to model the organizational structure. In typical software engineering projects, the artifacts managed using these two types of tools are not integrated with each other. This makes traceability, e.g. from a task to the according part of the specification, rather difficult. Furthermore, entities belonging to the system model, for instance requirements, have to be modeled redundantly in management tools if they are used for planning purposes. We also claim that specifications are more likely to be kept up-to-date if they are integrated with frequently visited views such as task lists. This paper presents a case study, in which the system under construction as well as the project management was modeled with a single unified tool.

It crystallizes this knowledge by building prototypes and artifacts to disseminate it quickly throughout large teams. It integrates best practices from traditional mechatronic development (e.g. Munich Procedural Model) with methods inspired by lean startup, scrum and design thinking. It coordinates cross-functional teams and helps to identify critical functions in order to build the right things before building them right. TAF is applied wherever companies need to adapt to a changing market, where the current business model or rather product lost its viability and where mechatronic products are developed de-novo.

In pair programming, two programmers work together on the same program: one writes while the other observes and guides. Pair programming interleaves development and inspection activities and has been shown to produce higher quality software in a shorter time than individuals working alone. Our adaptation of agile software development pair programming to qualitative research, which we have called pair-coding, uses a similar approach to merge the qualitative research activities of coding and consensus-building by having two team members work on the same text simultaneously. In using pair-coding in qualitative research, the active team member highlights passages and assigns codes while the other team member observes and guides. Our research team anecdotally found that pair-coding of qualitative data provided benefits that were similar to the benefits of pair programming. Specifically, consensus and consistency were built continuously rather than at discrete stages. As well, differences in biases and worldviews were overtly revealed in the act of coding, thus improving the bracketing of biases. Finally, we found that consensus was better understood when built in the moment of coding rather than in comparison after the fact. We believe pair-coding could be effective in supporting the trustworthiness and credibility of qualitative analysis.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637248","qualitative methods;intercoder agreement;pair-coding;agile methods","Codes;Conferences;Agile software development;Inspection;Encoding;Software;Programming profession","software prototyping;software quality","pair-coding;intercoder agreement;agile software development pair programming;qualitative research activities;trustworthiness","","","","28","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, understanding agile teams is crucial for the mobile software development industry. Thus, identifying and understanding enablers and inhibitors of agile teams in active learning environments has become a research opportunity among the software engineering research community and it is the main goal of this study. To achieve this study goal, we have performed a one-month case study with 50 individuals as part of a two-year mobile development course that teaches iOS development to undergraduate students in a Challenge Based Learning environment. In the course, students experience an agile environment developing mobile applications, dedicating 20 hours a week for the development of real world projects. The case study was conducted in two stages, both of which were held during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the first stage, we have found 33 positive aspects as well as 33 negative aspects reported by participants. However, on the second stage participants have reported 30 positive aspects and 35 negative aspects. The set of both positive aspects and negative aspects partially repeats from the first stage to the second stage. We concluded that team relationship, communication and engagement positively influence mobile application development in agile environments. At the same time, this study also presented negative influences for mobile application development teams, such as teams working remotely (because of COVID-19), lack of knowledge and bad planning.

A proof-of-concept of the method is given by a case study of release planning for a tool called Agilefant, which is developed with a process partially based on Scrum. The benefits of the method as demonstrated by the case study are: (i) better decisions by the product manager by relying on more objective information, (ii) more transparency of release decisions, and (iii) efficient tool support accompanying the whole process.","1530-1605","978-1-4244-5510-2","10.1109/HICSS.2010.323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5428538","","Process planning;Costs;Technology planning;Iterative methods;Resource management;Decision support systems;Mathematical programming;Product development;Crystallization;Aggregates","decision making;decision support systems;process planning;product development;production planning","product release planning;iterative product development;stakeholder centric approach;process planning;Agilefant;Scrum;decision support","","6","","30","","11 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several authors therefore recommend adaptive project management practices - sometimes named “targeted flexibility” - that respond to project characteristics commonly found in innovation, namely novelty, complexity, speed and - as a result - uncertainty. This paper investigates how this proposed adaptation of project management occurs in a context with high levels of novelty that organizes work in projects and needs to accommodate projects of different pace, complexity and innovativeness: product development in small and medium enterprises that do research and development work in the same organizational unit. Results of a literature review and two exploratory studies, covering a total of 8 companies with multiple projects each, are presented. Implications for a future framework for targeted flexibility are developed, leading to the identification of the following needs for project management: (1) better understanding of the many ways in which project management impacts exploration and exploitation activities, (2) improved attention for the currently poorly supported pre-project and early initiation stages, (3) a shift of focus from monitoring against plans toward monitoring against achieved learning, and (4) the formulation of transition paths from current new product development practice to higher project management maturity.","2159-5100","978-1-8908-4331-1","10.1109/PICMET.2015.7273107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273107","","Technological innovation;Product development;Planning;Project management;Companies;Logic gates","innovation management;product development;project management;small-to-medium enterprises","targeted flexibility;innovative initiatives;planning;learning-based strategy;adaptive project management practices;project characteristics;innovation;novelty;complexity;small-and-medium enterprise;research and development;exploration activities;exploitation activities;new product development","","3","","67","","24 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

What makes the Systematic experience unique, is the larger focus of the problem solving effort, at an organizational level, in which individual projects are used as experiments to try out countermeasures to address root causes. This is possible because Systematic, based on a CMMI focus, already employs a level of standard work across project and product engagements so that we can apply learning from an experiment on one project to future projects. Experience from the past five years has resulted in significant improvements to our processes including our Scrum implementation, and has revealed insight into five key measures to monitor projects.

The main challenge in doing so is to assess whether students apply the methods correctly without requiring complete supervision throughout the entire project. This paper presents experiences from a classroom project where 38 students developed a single system using a scaled version of Scrum. Surveys helped us to identify which elements of Scrum correlated most with student satisfaction or posed the biggest challenges. These insights were augmented by a team of tutors, which accompanied main meetings throughout the project to provide feedback to the teams, and captured impressions of method application in practice. Finally, we performed a post-hoc, tool-supported analysis of collaboration artifacts to detect concrete indicators for anti-patterns in Scrum adoption. Through the combination of these techniques we were able to understand how students implemented Scrum in this course and which elements require further lecturing and tutoring in future iterations. Automated analysis of collaboration artifacts proved to be a promising addition to the development process that could potentially reduce manual efforts in future courses and allow for more concrete and targeted feedback, as well as more objective assessment.","","978-1-4503-4205-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883315","Classroom project;Scrum;multi-level assessment;collaboration analysis","Software;Education;Software engineering;Scrum (Software development);Collaboration;Planning;Synchronization","computer science education;project management;software prototyping","classroom software engineering project;agile methods;scaled Scrum version;student satisfaction;post-hoc tool-supported analysis;collaboration artifacts;Scrum adoption","","1","","21","","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But recent evidence suggests that technology projects either fail to reach their goals or fail completely. Project management style is the management paradigm that guides the managers of an organization in perceiving and dealing with the management problems. Like other human intellectual processes, project management styles are influenced by the scientific paradigms. Classical project management is based on the scientific management theories which are based on the mechanistic Newtonian paradigm, where universe is assumed to be deterministic. But during the last decades of the 20th century the complexity paradigm based on the chaos and complex adaptive system theories emerged as a contender paradigm. This paper aims to develop measures for assessing project technology complexity and project management styles by employing a survey of project management professionals. The results of confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses provide strong evidence that the final measures for project technology complexity and project management styles have adequate validity and reliability.

The motivation factor is the paradigm shift that is being experimented in the higher education context, with a high increment of the competition at international level and with the irruption of new kinds of teaching, such as the massive adoption of eLearning and the Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC). Due to this conversion, higher education organizations are investing gargantuan quantities of money and resources to develop and implant analytic systems. Most of these analytic systems are unsuccessful either because they deviate from the initial planning or do not solve the proposed analytic problem. A similar situation happened before in the enterprise context, where the analytical orientation was adopted previously. In this paper we propose to adapt the experience and maturity of the enterprise environment in the specification, development and implantation of analytic systems in order to define a project management roadmap adapted to the university environment. The proposed roadmap take into account lessons learnt in order to provide guides that allow defining, conducting and closing projects to develop and implant analytic systems systematically and increase the potential success of the project. The roadmap gives support to: 1) defining the analytic project, by evaluating whether the university is ready to develop and use an analytic system and whether the analytic problem is real and relevant for the university, 2) conducting the development of the analytic system, by providing a set of critical success factors to take into account and indicators to use to monitor the development activity, and 3) implanting and validating the analytic system, by following strategies for a successful implantation of the system, a successful adoption of the system for its potential users and a validation of its impact and utility in the university.","","978-1-5090-0987-9","10.1109/CISIS.2016.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7791870","analytical system;project management;higher education;roadmap;enterprise","Context;Education;Project management;Information systems;Organizations;Implants;Strategic planning","courseware;further education;project management","university environment;project management roadmap;analytical orientation;enterprise context;implant analytic systems;higher education organizations;MOOC;massive online open courses;eLearning;international level;motivation factor;term analytics;data-oriented philosophy;higher education environment;analytic projects","","2","","25","","22 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quantitative approaches include sizing functional requirements with standards such as ISO 19761, known as the COSMIC method. But defects in the requirements may have an impact on the accuracy of the resulting functional size, as well as an impact on the project relative effort sometimes known as the 'productivity rate' and the measurement relative effort. Our research program is investigating the relationship between the attributes of requirements engineering (RE) outputs, the software process relative effort, and the measurement process relative effort. RE outputs studied are requirements and specifications documents and data models. As functional sizing is applied, thorough examination of RE outputs is done, which is likely to lead to identifying quality attributes and related findings. As a case study, this paper reports preliminary results related to the quality of requirements artefacts from a software development organization that is applying the Agile approach to its software development process. The functional size of the software developed through five projects was measured and compared with development effort and measurement effort, taking into account the quality rating of requirements. The results led to recommendations of improvement on the RE process that the organization could deploy in its current and next software projects. This paper also presents a list of functional sizing challenges that the measurer has faced, leading to proposed recommendations for planning any software measurement project.","","978-1-4799-4174-2","10.1109/IWSM.Mensura.2014.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000106","Functional size;COSMIC;FSM;Measure;Quality;Defects;Requirements engineering","Software;Size measurement;Software measurement;Organizations;Productivity;Estimation;Accuracy","formal specification;formal verification;software cost estimation;software process improvement;software prototyping;software quality","requirements engineering quality;functional size measurement;software development organizations;software process improvement;decision making;software project estimation process;ISO 19761 standards;COSMIC method;functional sizing;agile approach;software measurement project","","8","","29","","5 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Often, risks lead to late project delivery, commercial losses, or even project failure. Nonetheless, diligent and efficient project planning and scheduling can assist to decrease such risks and their effects on project delivery, i.e., managing these risks. Further, building information modeling (BIM) can be a capable process of keeping stakeholders updated with the latest information, thus enhancing project communication and information flow. Combining the capabilities of BIM and the right scheduling technique would improve the deliverability and constructability of projects. A questionnaire has been distributed to measure the effects of four-dimensional (4-D) BIM on the construction industry. The survey analysis stated that 51% of the candidates use the Critical Path Method technique over the others, and BIM is positively affecting the project coordination, clash detection, and design validation. It, also, concludes the high efficiency and benefits obtained from utilizing 4-D BIM. Ultimately, the results, also, stated clearly that the project planning and scheduling including sequence assessment is much easier in the 4-D BIM environment than the traditional 2-D planning.","1937-4178","","10.1109/EMR.2019.2916365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8713594","4D BIM;4D BIM barriers;4D BIM benefits;BIM;CPM;LBMS;construction planning;and scheduling","Job shop scheduling;Companies;Sociology;Statistics;Mathematical model","building management systems;buildings (structures);construction industry;project management;scheduling;structural engineering computing","project scheduling techniques;building information modeling environment;BIM;survey study;construction project;late project delivery;commercial losses;project communication;information flow;scheduling technique;deliverability;construction industry;Critical Path Method technique;project coordination;project planning;sequence assessment","","1","","11","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Planning and managing complex supply chains requires the definition and observance of metrics representing agile capabilities as critical performance factors. Agility metrics are difficult to define, due to the the concept of agility with its multidimensionality and vagueness. Some definitions of agility are given, and the link between agility and the related concepts of flexibility and adaptability is discussed. A majority of measurement frameworks rely on financial metrics or evaluate the performance of individual business functions, neglecting strategic orientation. Some are using concepts like complexity or flexibility as surrogate measures. Few models follow a truly holistic approach. This paper discusses different models to define and operationalize agility. The models are examined for their approach and applicability for measuring agility in supply chains. The frameworks are classified for their scope, their agility focus and their approach to measurement.","","978-0-86341-816-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286478","","","agile manufacturing;market opportunities;organisational aspects;supply chain management","supply chain agility;market opportunities;business function","","","","","","8 Aug 2007","","","IET","IET Conferences"

So which ones should finally be implemented in the next product release and why? Which features are not valuable enough and are better avoided or postponed? The planning of product upgrades by deciding which new features and releases to introduce when, is part of strategic release planning. In release planning there is a fine line between revenues by value provision, and cost effects. However, today's market-driven mechatronic and electronic products pose a challenge to current domain-specific and feasibility-driven planning concepts. Current practice and literature therefore highlights the need for operatively applicable methods to support strategic release planning with value-oriented and cross-domain views. Therefore, this paper aims to present a methodological concept to support value-oriented strategic release planning.","","978-1-5386-7220-4","10.1109/IEEM45057.2020.9309756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9309756","Release planning;Product management;Product evolution;Feature selection;Value orientation","Planning;Systematics;Interviews;Complexity theory;Industries;Timing;Software","decision making;product development;strategic planning","value-oriented strategic release planning;product release;product upgrades;planning concepts;continuous product upgrade;value-oriented view;cross-domain view","","4","","19","","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the knowledge management (KM) cornerstones is improving productivity by effective knowledge sharing and transfer. However, from the game theory perspective, the main constraint is that people tend not to collaborate in uncertainty conditions, when collaborative behavior is not guaranteed, and sharing knowledge is time- and effort-consuming. Therefore, KM must be a practical aspect of the general organizational culture. Specifically, software development is a knowledge-intensive activity and its success depends heavily on the developers' knowledge and experience. In this presentation we highlight how the agile approach initiates a culture change that is in line with the culture change needed for a KM initiative. We discuss KM enablers that are embedded in the agile software engineering approach, and illustrate how collaborating processes and knowledge transparency can weaken the dilemmas people face and lead to better knowledge extraction and sharing.","","978-1-4244-3712-2","10.1109/CHASE.2009.5071412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071412","","Knowledge management;Programming;Educational products;Educational technology;Collaboration;Uncertainty;Employee rights;Laboratories;Industrial engineering;Asset management","knowledge acquisition;knowledge management;software engineering","knowledge management;agile software development;knowledge sharing;knowledge transfer;game theory;knowledge-intensive activity;knowledge extraction;knowledge transparency;agile software engineering","","25","","22","","12 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We also need to discover how successful geographically distributed agile development (GDAD) organizations deal with these challenges. Literature review: Most previous studies reported that the critical challenges facing GDAD communication can be categorized into five themes: differences in cultures, different time zones, different spoken languages, different personal skills, and the efficiency and effectiveness of communication tools used. Research questions: 1. What are the challenges of communication between GDAD teams? 2. How can the impact of GDAD communication challenges be mitigated? Methodology: Data were collected by interviewing 12 members of a three-team organization using distributed agile development. These teams are distributed over three countries; the main team located in Australia, the developers’ team located in China, and the testers’ team located in India. A thematic analysis technique was used to identify communication challenges and practices used to mitigate the effect of these challenges. Results: Our findings reveal that the five challenges are still critical to GDAD. Moreover, we report a new critical challenge of communication in GDAD, the insufficient documentation provided by distributed teams and members. In addition, we recommend several practices to mitigate the impact of these challenges. Conclusions: Communication among distributed agile development teams still faces several critical challenges, and the solutions to these challenges provided in recent years have not been sufficient. This fact prompts the need for more research on how the impact of these challenges can be lessened.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2021.3110396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583949","Challenge;communication;geographically distributed agile development (GDAD);recommendation","Agile software development;Companies;Teamwork;Systematics;Project management","groupware;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;team working","GDAD communication challenges;three-team organization;geographically distributed agile development teams;face communication;geographically distributed agile development organizations;GDAD teams;critical communication challenges","","","","51","IEEE","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The success rates of IT projects are still low. A number of studies have been carried out to understand the key success factors and hindrances of IT related projects but most of them are focused to the software industry and only a few focused to the IT related undergraduate students projects. Thus, the objective of this research was to reveal the underlying reasons of making success in IT projects from the undergraduate students perspective. To attain this objective, an empirical study was carried out in an engineering institution in Bangladesh. The study was replicated with the 95 undergraduate students major in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) program. The study data was collected using the questionnaire approach and analysis using the content analysis and the affinity diagram. The study revealed a total of ten success factors for the successful completion of IT-related students' projects. The outcomes will help all parties (teachers, students and administration) of an academic institution to improve the awareness and to diagnose problems at the beginning of pursuing any IT related projects, which in turn will contribute to improve the overall success of IT-related students' projects. The paper also explored the possible implications of the revealed factors for teachers, students, administrators and policy makers in an academic institution.","","978-1-7281-9105-8","10.1109/ITMS51158.2020.9259323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259323","IT projects;computer education;success factors;project success;affinity diagram","Industries;Software;Computer science;Organizations;Project management;Planning;Focusing","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;further education;human factors;information technology","key success factors;success rates;information technology related projects;software industry;IT related undergraduate student projects;engineering institution;Bangladesh;Computer Science and Engineering program;CSE;content analysis;affinity diagram;academic institution;diagnose problems","","2","","21","","19 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the instructional strategies used to help students take advantage of these activities focus on supporting agile programming, which is appropriate for capstone courses. This is not always recommended in initial software engineering project courses, however, where novice developers run projects in teams while simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario, this paper proposes a formative monitoring method, reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM), for use in project courses that involve disciplined software processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional scenario studied. While students in the monitored teams were more effective and coordinated, and experienced a higher sense of team belonging and satisfaction, little evidence was found of them being more productive than students working in non-monitored teams.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2017.2742989","Project Fondef IDeA(grant numbers:IT13I20010); Ph.D. Scholarship Program of Conicyt Chile (CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional)(grant numbers:2012-21120544); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8026185","Collaborative learning;disciplined software process;formative monitoring;project-based learning;reflexive monitoring;reflective practice;software engineering project course;team performance;teamwork","Monitoring;Software;Software engineering;Tools;Productivity;Industries;Teamwork","computer science education;educational courses;project management;software engineering;team working","team belonging;team satisfaction;academic studies;real-world software projects;student learning experience;nonmonitored teams;individual team performance;collaborative learning practices;disciplined software processes;RWM;reflexive weekly monitoring;formative monitoring method;latter instructional scenario;teamwork experience;initial software engineering project courses;capstone courses;agile programming;instructional strategies","","36","","61","IEEE","6 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem should involve the consideration of numerous aspects such as road geometry, lane-structured roads, traffic regulations, traffic participants, and vehicle physical limitations. Furthermore, dynamically changing movements of surrounding vehicles make the problem more challenging. It requires the planner's ability to react to the changes in the driving environments in real time. To solve this problem, sampling and numerical optimization-based trajectory planners were introduced. However, these methods have their own limitations in generating a safe trajectory in these dynamic scenarios. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning scheme to integrate the strength of the sampling and optimization methods. With the sampling method for a lateral movement, the planner can deal with various trajectories with multiple maneuvers. This helps the planner to generate a reactive trajectory in a dynamically changing environment. The numerical optimization of a longitudinal movement enables the planner to adapt to diverse situations without restriction of predefined patterns for specific driving purposes. The proposed method was implemented with an embedded optimization coder and C++ environment. Based on this, its performance was evaluated through simulation and real driving tests in various on-road dynamic scenarios.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2019.2957797","BK21 Plus Program through the Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea(grant numbers:22A20130000045); Industrial Strategy Technology Development Program(grant numbers:10039673,10060068,10042633,10079961,10080284); International Collaborative Research and Development Program through the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE Korea)(grant numbers:N0001992); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant Funded by the Korean Government(grant numbers:2011-0017495,2019R1G1A1099806); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8932661","Planning;trajectory planning;motion planning;trajectory generation;path planning;autonomous driving;dynamic scenario;lane change;hybrid;sampling;optimization","Trajectory;Trajectory planning;Planning;Roads;Optimization;Autonomous vehicles;Vehicle dynamics","collision avoidance;mobile robots;optimisation;path planning;road vehicles;sampling methods;trajectory control","hybrid trajectory planning;on-road dynamic scenarios;safe trajectory;on-road autonomous driving;driving environments;numerous aspects;road geometry;lane-structured roads;traffic regulations;traffic participants;vehicle physical limitations;planner;numerical optimization-based trajectory planners;optimization methods;sampling method;lateral movement;reactive trajectory;dynamically changing environment;longitudinal movement;specific driving purposes;embedded optimization coder;C++ environment;driving tests","","18","","36","IEEE","13 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To do so, the study explores systems thinking and artificial neural networks to shed light on complexity in software-project behavior using nonlinear functional relationships between critical success factors and project success to utilize their connectedness as an approach in order to create project-outcome prediction models. The artificial neural networks were used to create two project-outcome prediction models: one for a binary classification task to discriminate failed from successful projects using a multi-input-single-output configuration and one for a multi-task binary classification to discriminate success from failure in multiple project-success dimensions using a multi-input multi-output configuration. The results yielded high-performance values for a binary classification task, performed to predict overall project success, and slightly lower performance values for the multi-task binary classification, which was also performed to predict success in project-success dimensions. It was found that the nonlinear behavior of critical success factors may be used to create prediction models, by embedding equifinality and connectedness constructs that prove to be useful to understand projects as complex, multi-loop, and nonlinear systems. Further research is needed to investigate the causality between critical success factors in order to explore the possible propagation of critical success factors within a project system network and its implications on project success.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268157","Artificial neural networks;critical success factors;project success;prediction models;systems thinking","Software;Predictive models;Stakeholders;Project management;Artificial neural networks;Systems thinking;Complexity theory","neural nets;nonlinear functions;pattern classification;project management;software development management","project system network;systems thinking;software projects;artificial neural networks;critical success factors;project-outcome prediction models;binary classification task;multiinput-single-output configuration;multitask binary classification;multiple project-success dimensions;multiinput multioutput configuration;project management;multiloop system;nonlinear system","","2","","106","CCBY","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Projects can collaborate either serially or in parallel, yet at other times they compete with each other to test different approaches for the same goal. In such organizations, it is not uncommon for the wrong project to be funded or a right project to be under funded apparently for all the right reasons. In turn these project failures can cause big problems to their dependent projects, even having catastrophic impacts to the whole organization. Given a limited budget, it is critical to the organization's success to strategically optimize the set of projects that are initiated, and for these projects to be able to depend on their selected project dependencies or collaborators. Conceptually this is obvious, but in practice to identify the right set of projects and to allocate the right amount of budget is very challenging. We propose an approach to tackle the problem from a risk management perspective: first model each project as a chain of executable tasks and model the organization as a network of tasks; then optimize the budget allocation from the system's perspective.","","978-1-4673-2401-4","10.1109/SOLI.2012.6273580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6273580","budget allocation optimization;project management;risk management","USA Councils;Standards organizations;Organizations;Irrigation;Proposals;Welding","budgeting data processing;organisational aspects;project management;risk management;strategic planning","budget allocation optimization;complex multiproject environment;project serial collaboration;project parallel collaboration;project failures;catastrophic impacts;strategic project optimization;project dependencies;risk management","","","","25","","20 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The process by which a piece of CSE software begins life as a set of research requirements and then matures into a trusted high-quality capability is both commonplace and extremely challenging. Although an implicit lifecycle is obviously being used in any effort, the challenges of this process-respecting the competing needs of research vs. production-cannot be overstated. Here we describe a proposal for a well-defined software life-cycle process based on modern Lean/Agile software engineering principles. What we propose is appropriate for many CSE software projects that are initially heavily focused on research but also are expected to eventually produce usable high-quality capabilities. The model is related to TriBITS, a build, integration and testing system, which serves as a strong foundation for this lifecycle model, and aspects of this lifecycle model are ingrained in the TriBITS system. Indeed this lifecycle process, if followed, will enable large-scale sustainable integration of many complex CSE software efforts across several institutions.","","978-1-4673-4466-1","10.1109/eScience.2012.6404448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6404448","","Production;Testing;Maintenance engineering;Software engineering;Software quality;Computational modeling","program testing;project management;software prototyping;trusted computing","TriBITS lifecycle model;agile software lifecycle model;lean software lifecycle model;research-based computational science and engineering software;research requirements;trusted high-quality capability;CSE software projects;build-integration-testing system;large-scale sustainable integration","","4","","16","","10 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From IBM experience is key to have a Smart city the following three factors implemented: they instrument (sensors installed in the city to capture data), then must be interconnected (send gathered information from sensors to some place) and finally enable technologically to produce new levels of intelligence. As smart cities grow, living labs are created as platforms to test these solutions in a real-life context before implementing them on cities. Hosting smart cities' themed hackathons is an excellent way for empowering and engaging citizens to be aware of how their active participation can positively affect the quality of life in their cities. Nowadays, there are multiple hackathons across the globe, typically the outcome of those hackathons are not being implemented in the urban places because a lack of a place to test ""prototypes"" in a controlled environment, here is where Living Labs play a significant role in the development of smart cities solutions. T o create high-quality deliverables, a well-controlled Living Lab is needed, also the follow up of all the ideas generated is a key factor. In this work, a method and “model” to successfully implement solutions in smart cities designed in a Hackathon, Semesterathon or Summerathons described, including usage of Agile and Design Thinking methodologies. Also, a model that integrate the smart cities ecosystem and leading edge technologies (i.e. Using Cognitive API's via IBM Bluemix “Platform As A Service”), under this new Era of Cognitive Computing explained. In in this work, we defined and outlined the key performance indicators (i.e. KPI), that will allow improvement in the success rate of the solutions that will be developed and deploy initially at CUCEA Living Lab and finally deployed at smart cities.","","978-1-5386-2524-8","10.1109/ISC2.2017.8090838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8090838","Smart Cities;Hackathon;Innovation;Living Lab;Agile and Design Thinking Methodologies","Smart cities;Technological innovation;Government;Prototypes","cloud computing;innovation management;public administration;smart cities;town and country planning","living labs;smart cities solutions;smart cities ecosystem;hackathons;semesterathons;summerathons;smart city local talent development;innovation promotion;active participation;key performance indicators;KPI;agile methodologies;design thinking methodologies;citizens empowerment;citizens engagement;platform as a service","","2","","14","","2 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, providing transformational leadership starts with the leadership itself along with the development of the three core competencies of strategy, solutions, and implementation. Your job in IT leadership is to develop all three competencies in your organization by cultivating the necessary skills and techniques, and then to cause each of them to happen continuously and concurrently.

However, extant agility research primarily covers the corporate and project levels and is typically located in the information systems and operations management fields. Relatively little quantitative research in innovation management literature exists, and those studies approached the concept solely from an outcome perspective (i.e., increased adaptiveness) instead of elucidating how organizations should organize themselves to be agile (i.e., a capability perspective). This article addresses these shortcomings and adopts a capability perspective since no empirical studies have examined agile R&D units’ organization (ARDO). Drawing on dynamic capabilities theory, we develop a measure of ARDO, conceptualizing it as a second-order construct, consisting of six dimensions: a culture of agile values, customer integration, autonomy, an iterative work method, cross-functional capabilities, and flat hierarchies. We validated the measurement by conducting three studies to ensure content, structural, and nomological validity. We applied structural equation modeling on a sample of 175 R&D managers and cross validated our findings on different hierarchical levels via a sample of 454 R&D employees. The results confirm the second-order nature of the ARDO measure and provide evidence of its positive relationship with front-end success. We advance scarce quantitative research on agility's neglected capability perspective and contribute to the innovation management field by facilitating further empirical research on agile R&D units’ antecedents and outcomes in the context of physical product development.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3108343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9548690","Agile R and D units;agility;dynamic capabilities;front end of innovation;scale development","Research and development;Technological innovation;Software;Iterative methods;Product development;Sensors;Manufacturing","","","","","","","IEEE","27 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Stelzmann","Graz, University of Technology, Austria","IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","27 Jun 2012","2012","27","5","17","22","Discussion about agility within Systems Engineering is ongoing [9,10,13] but there had been little discussion about the right context for it. This proposed a classification scheme for the right context of the Agile Development Cycle that was identified to be the main principle of agile development. Prior work about the context of agile software development [5,7, 8] was taken as the basis. Interviews in system developing companies were used to investigate the differences between context of agile software and systems development (hardware systems). It was found that the nature of the system is not only the main difference between the two domains but also the main driver for the right context of the Agile Development Cycle. In contrast to software, hardware systems that have to be produced physically often are difficult to be developed in small cyclic steps. Only if prototyping, testing, and implementing changes can be done quickly and cheaply, this principle is feasible. The system should not be safety-critical as well. Another requirement for feasibility is the willingness of customer to support this kind of development. On the other hand, some factors were identified to drive the demand for agility, like market dynamism, level of innovation, and rate of change. Therefore the context of Agile Systems Engineering was classified into the two dimensions: feasibility and demand. Some company examples were given to describe the different situations in this classification scheme. By using the factors one company can be classified within the scheme. So we find if the Agile Development Cycle can be put into the right context. For a situation where the Cycle is not feasible but agility is needed it we also show how it could be applied partially.","1557-959X","","10.1109/MAES.2012.6226690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6226690","","Systems engineering and theory;Adaptive systems;Modeling;Hierarchical systems;Programming;Product life cycle management","","","","7","","","","27 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We identified five major shifts in R&D-based business environment that affect project planning and execution, and the way people work in teams. These paradigm shifts must be understood for managing and leading R&D organizations effectively, and for defining appropriate policy guidelines for aligning the R&D projects appropriately with the overall enterprise strategy. Further, the results suggest a need for structuring management processes that deal with these changes and strategic issues.

Various estimation approaches (e.g., Planning Poker, Analogy, and expert judgment) are widely-used, yet they are still inaccurate and may be subjective, leading to ineffective sprint planning. Recent work proposed Deep-SE, a deep learning-based Agile story point estimation approach, yet it is still inaccurate, not transferable to other projects, and not interpretable. In this paper, we propose GPT2SP, a Transformer-based Agile Story Point Estimation approach. Our GPT2SP employs a GPT-2 pre-trained language model with a GPT-2 Transformer-based architecture, allowing our GPT2SP models to better capture the relationship among words while considering the context surrounding a given word and its position in the sequence and be transferable to other projects, while being interpretable. Through an extensive evaluation on 23,313 issues that span across 16 open-source software projects with 10 existing baseline approaches for within- and cross-project scenarios, our results show that our GPT2SP approach achieves a median MAE of 1.16, which is (1) 34%-57% more accurate than existing baseline approaches for within-project estimations; (2) 39%-49% more accurate than existing baseline approaches for cross-project estimations. The ablation study also shows that the GPT-2 architecture used in our approach substantially improves Deep-SE by 6%-47%, highlighting the significant advancement of the AI for Agile story point estimation. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept tool to help practitioners better understand the most important words that contributed to the story point estimation of the given issue with the best supporting examples from past estimates. Our survey study with 16 Agile practitioners shows that the story point estimation task is perceived as an extremely challenging task. In addition, our AI-based story point estimation with explanations is perceived as more useful and trustworthy than without explanations, highlighting the practical need of our Explainable AI-based story point estimation approach.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3158252","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DE200100941); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732669","Agile Story Point Estimation;AI for SE;Explainable AI","Estimation;Transformers;Computer architecture;Planning;Task analysis;Training;Artificial intelligence","","","","1","","","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The paper argues that, in the case of innovation projects, these mechanisms of institutionalization mediate the interplay between project-level implementation and the wider spread of RP systems innovation by shifting the 'knowledge barriers' which arise between the designers and users of an innovation over time by Attewell, P.

An analysis of the extant literature reveals a disparate set of studies across each individual method, with no cross-method comparison based on empirical evidence. This systematic literature review compares the main large-scale agile methods, namely SAFe, LeSS, Scrum-at-Scale, DAD, and the Spotify model. It is the first study to analyse and compare each of the method's principles, practices, tools, and metrics in a standardised manner. For each method, it presents not just the original method specifications but also all extensions and modifications to each method proposed by subsequent empirical research. It includes in this comparison not just commercial large-scale methods but also those that have been custom-built in organisations such as Nokia, Ericsson, and others. Based on the findings reported in this study, practitioners can make a more informed decision as to which commercial method or method component or, indeed, custom-built method is better suited to their needs. Our study reveals a number of theoretical and practical issues in the current literature, such as an emphasis on the practices of commercial frameworks at the expense of their underlying principles, or indeed any of the custom method.

The model considers the mechatronic engineering process starting from the requirements engineering up to the final acceptance test of the production system. It outlines a three-layer-concept: The top layer consists of process areas along the mechatronic engineering process. The second layer stripes down and details each process area into several activity groups whilst the third layer deduces planning steps per activity group.

The focus on organizational structure is important since the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) depends more on highperformance computing and the co-existence of technology with human resources. A case study was conducted in a technology company in South Africa which had restructured their software department from a top-down reporting structure to a matrix structure (dual management system). This research identified gaps in the current roles of the managers and in the matrix structure itself. The focus of the research was to identify the factors that were negatively influenced by the matrix structure such as the quality of the projects produced, the level of risk involved and return on investment from the projects delivered. It was found that functional teams were hemorrhaging 9.56% of employees through resignations and projects were only achieving 94.17% of their objectives.","2157-362X","978-1-7281-3804-6","10.1109/IEEM44572.2019.8978830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8978830","cross-functional teams (CFT);project manager (PM);functional manager (FM);project management institute (PMI);subject matter experts (SME);software development life cycle (SDLC)","","human resource management;investment;organisational aspects;personnel;project management","functional managers;matrix organization;technological change;capital expenditure projects;good project management;project management structure;functional project managers;project performance;matrix structure;organizational structure;fourth industrial revolution;reporting structure;dual management system;current roles;functional teams","","","","14","","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, only a few empirical studies investigate the dynamics and impacts of Kanban on projects. The aim of this study is to improve the understanding on how Kanban impacts on software project work. For the purpose of the study, a framework is developed and empirically investigated in an experimental software R&D setting called Software Factory. The impact of Kanban is evaluated from nine theoretically derived perspectives. The results highlight new findings regarding the application of Kanban in the software context. This bears managerial implications, which is addressed. The key implications of the findings suggest that Kanban and its inherent simplicity motivate the workers and control the project activities.","","978-0-7695-4381-9","10.1109/ICECCS.2011.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5773404","software development;Kanban;project management;process model","Software;Programming;Visualization;Documentation;Interviews;Lead;Project management","kanban;project management;software development management","software project work;software project management;Kanban method;software R&D setting;software factory","","24","","61","","27 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, few detailed reports of these public engagement plans exist in either scholarly venues or government reports. This case reviews one public engagement project in transportation planning as implemented by one professional communications firm. Research questions: 1) What communication and engagement strategies do the consultants employ in their public engagement process? 2) How do professional communicators design engagement for diverse citizen groups? Situating the case: A number of cases have revealed the ways professional and technical communicators integrate participatory or user-centered design strategies in public engagement projects. These cases suggest that professional and technical communicators are uniquely positioned to develop ethical and effective public engagement plans for environmental impact studies. Professional and technical communicators are further prepared for this work because of their knowledge about theories of intercultural communication and rhetorical theories of delivery. Methodology: This case was studied over the course of 1.5 years using qualitative research methods, including observations, interviews, and textual analysis. About the case: This case reviews the work of one particular public engagement firm, VTC Communications, as they planned and implemented public engagement in one environmental impact study. This environmental impact study team was tasked with determining the best way to accommodate the increase in rail traffic the city anticipated with the development of the high-speed rail. The public's input was needed to fulfill environmental impact statement (EIS) requirements and to fully understand the community concerns regarding the increased traffic, noise, vibrations, and family/business displacements. VTC Communications was hired to conduct this portion of the environmental impact study, and their work included the development of a range of deliverables and events. Conclusions: This case provides an overview of the process of developing public engagement plans, the deliverables designed, as well as the key goals that guided the development of public engagement. My case suggests that effective public engagement can address intercultural concerns by developing projects that are adaptable, multimodal, and dialogic.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2016.2583278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515000","Environmental impact statement;Environmental impact study;public engagement;public engagement plans;public involvement;public participation;transportation planning","Decision making;Planning;Professional communication;Transportation;Cultural differences;Focusing;Urban areas","environmental factors;planning;professional communication;transportation;user centred design","environmental impact studies;professional communication;transportation planning;technical communicators;professional communicators;user-centered design;intercultural communication;rhetorical theory of delivery;public engagement firm;VTC communications;environmental impact statement requirements;EIS requirements;public engagement plans","","7","","29","IEEE","18 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a consequence of the shortened product life-cycles, agile development becomes more important. It fosters cross-functional project work and enables a team to react fast and flexible to a continuously changing environment. Central aspect of the agile approach within physical product development is prototyping. This work identifies criteria to analyze the use of physical prototypes within an agile set up. Therefore, a Makeathon has been analyzed. In contrast to plan-driven development, prototypes are used to explore, design, verify, test the usability or communicate product aspects. They support the learning process by providing important insights about the solution space on which the planning of the next iteration is based. The data also support the assumption that there is not “one” approach in agile product development.

The methodologies of modern project management are highly analytic, usually requiring automated tools to support them on large projects. Like most other disciplines, it is learned through both practice and study. Project management encompasses many different skills, such as understanding the interdependencies among people, technologies, budgets, and expectations; planning the project to maximize productivity; motivating others to execute the plan; analyzing the actual results; and reworking and tuning the plan to deal with the realities of what really happens as the project is executed. In order to manage a project and bring it to a successful completion, its project manager must have a complete understanding of the methodologies being used for the management of different parts of the project. Managers prefer specific project methodology, while resist and face difficulties for an opportunity to manage another project with different methodology as they don’t know how much commonality exists between the preferred and the new required methodology.","2155-899X","978-1-4244-2327-9","10.1109/ITSIM.2008.4631556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4631556","","Project management;Organizations;Standards;Companies;Documentation;Planning;Schedules","","","","2","","11","","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are complexities in current EAIM's method, practice, and modelling, which cause ineffectiveness on EA implementation. This research aims to state current problems of existing EAIMs and represent the usage of Agent Oriented Technology (AOT) on developing an effective EAIM, which can address the ineffectiveness of EA implementation. AOT has several potentials in its modelling methods, practices, and development phases, which can contribute on developing an effective EAIM. AOT can reduce the complexity of EA implementation, increase the alignment between business and IT, provide appropriate requirement analysis for developing, reduces impedance mismatches between different development phases. This research opens new topics in AOT and EA domain, which would follow by other researcher and extend the usage of AOT in IT and Information Systems.","","978-1-4799-5439-1","10.1109/MySec.2014.6986039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986039","Enterprise Architecture;EAIM;Agent Oriented Methodology;Agent-Oriented Technology;Implementation Methodology","Computer architecture;Business;Complexity theory;Information systems;Software;Computational modeling;Planning","business data processing;information systems;object-oriented methods","agent-oriented technology;enterprise architecture implementation methodology;EA project;information technology;IT;EAIM;project management;project development;project maintenance;AOT;information systems","","","","42","","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main crux of agile software development is to break the development tasks into small increments, which entails minimal planning & documentation and focuses on delivery of the increment rather than the entire software. This thus minimizes the project risk and allows the project to adapt to changes quickly. The Department of Information Technology at Manipal University Dubai had applied the principles of agility to develop the Department Portal through the efforts of its graduating students under supervision of the IT Project Cell. This paper brings out the experiences of this case study and the lessons learnt in this unique experiment. The findings published in this paper may be of particular interest to other Universities or Organizations which are evaluating the options of making changes to their traditional software development methodology to achieve efficiency and effectiveness in their software development processes.

In this tutorial, we examine the real issues at stake, beyond the rhetoric and posturing, and show that the two cultures can coexist and support each other, where appropriate. We define heuristics to scope how much architecture a project really needs, to assign actual value to an otherwise invisible architecture; and we review management and development practices that do work in the circumstances where some significant architectural effort is needed, when you are actually going to need it.","1558-1225","978-1-60558-719-6","10.1145/1810295.1810448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062266","agile process;software architecture","Computer architecture;Software architecture;Programming;Software;Tutorials;Documentation","software architecture;software development management;software prototyping;system documentation","agile software architecture;agile software development;lean software development;BUFD big up-front design;architectural issue;project architecture;architectural effort","","5","","14","","27 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These assumptions can fail at any time, with serious consequences. This paper presents a lightweight approach to assumption management (AM) designed to suit agile development. Assumptions were monitored for three months within a small agile team. Two key indicators were proposed for measuring AM success but only one was detected in the research results. A number of strong correlations were found between properties of assumptions. Data collection largely depended on the subjective judgements of the first author, but they were validated with some success by his colleagues. In some ways, assumption management was found to complement agile development. However, AM was not fully integrated into the team's development process, due to difficulty in adopting an 'assumption-aware ' way of thinking. Suggestions are offered on how this transition may be eased, and on how others might wish to build on this research.","","978-1-4244-3726-9","10.1109/SHARK.2009.5069110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5069110","","Programming;Condition monitoring;Documentation;Research and development management;Software development management;Risk analysis;Software design;Conferences;Security;Design methodology","software engineering","agile development;software development;assumption management","","2","","16","","5 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this it is required that the students are familiar with the major development process, ideally on the example of a concrete student project. During a one-semester software development seminar the students were grouped into 7 groups with 4-5 students each and each group was assigned eXtreme Programming, SCRUM or Open Unified Process as development process. Each student was asked to keep a development diary and answer questionnaires during and at the end of the project. Each group was asked to document the changes to their development process, identified development problems, employed mitigation strategies and the project progress in form of a retrospective report. Analysis of the reports revealed common issues and mitigation strategies, which can be classified into the following: meeting organization; communication; project roles, requirements engineering, continuous tests and process adherence. The employed mitigation strategies were classified into the same categories; quantified and evaluated regarding their respective effectiveness.","2153-0033","978-1-61284-993-5","10.1109/AFRCON.2011.6072135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6072135","education;development process;student exercises;process tailoring","Educational institutions;Programming profession;Internet;Conferences;Software engineering","computer science education;software engineering","mitigation strategies;agile industrial software development process;student software engineering projects;computer science education;employment;industrial environment;extreme programming;SCRUM;open unified process;requirements engineering;continuous tests;process adherence","","","","8","","10 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a need to understand what coordinating mechanisms are valuable for project and team coordination. Coordination mechanisms, such as meetings and Slack, can foster a smooth workflow but also fragment work by interrupting the focused work of developers. Objective: This study aimed to investigate valuable coordination mechanisms and how they can be balanced against the need for uninterrupted work periods. Method: We conducted 30 interviews and observed 109 meetings in five companies using agile software development methods. We used coordination-dependency mapping to identify valuable coordination mechanisms. Results: Valuable coordination mechanisms included instant messaging tools, daily stand-up meetings, boards, open work area, Scrum of Scrums, bug crush days, BizDev meetings, and Make it Happen meetings. Conclusion: We advise companies to identify valuable coordination mechanisms using coordination-dependency mapping and then to bundle, schedule, and substitute these coordination mechanisms to reduce interruptions to development work.","2574-1837","978-1-4503-9342-3","10.1145/3528579.3529182","Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:267704,309631); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796212","Meetings;Interruptions;Fragmented work;Communication;Theory;Teamwork;Large-scale agile;Start-up","Schedules;Computer bugs;Ecosystems;Companies;Instant messaging;Software;Scheduling","","","","","","34","","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this sense, embedded system projects may have more goals (derived from constraints) to achieve than regular software projects. Without pragmatic support, engineers from different disciplines are likely to neglect some project goals in the real-world embedded system projects. As a consequence, the success of embedded system projects may be more difficult to achieve than regular software projects. In this paper we report experiences gained during applying a goal driven project management methodology on several embedded system projects in a software company. We evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of our Goal-Driven Development (GDD) methodology in practice by both projects results and feedbacks from relevant stakeholders. The results of our study show that GDD enables embedded system project teams to systematically and effectively identify, understand, track, and ultimately realize the project goals to meet relevant stakeholders' expectations. Being supported by GDD, explicit linkages and assignments are established between goals and solutions with project team's commitments.","1949-3789","978-1-4577-2203-5","10.1109/ESEM.2011.60","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6092600","Embedded System Engineering;Project Management;Goal-Driven","Embedded systems;Project management;Hardware;Image color analysis;Measurement;Complexity theory","embedded systems;project management;software management","goal driven development method;embedded system project management;industrial experience report;software platforms;hardware platforms;software projects;goal driven development;GDD","","3","","11","","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using outdated practices was no longer viable as it could lead to reduced competitiveness and losing possible revenue. Therefore, many companies have turned to implementing agile software development methods to keep up with the fast-paced market. Agile allows them to develop quickly, consistently, and in a flexible manner. However, different approaches are better suited for different projects, and, sometimes, an approach combining appropriate aspects of several other approaches is the best option. This paper describes five popular agile software development approaches of which four can be considered ""pure"", namely Scrum, Lean, Kanban, and Kaizen, and a hybrid approach called Scrumban. The paper then aims to assess other possible combinations of the approaches, both found in the literature and those not yet considered.","2623-8764","978-953-233-103-5","10.23919/MIPRO55190.2022.9803402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9803402","agile software development methods;Lean;Scrum;Kanban;Kaizen;Scrumban","Companies;Software;Complexity theory;Continuous improvement;Scrum (Software development);Consumer electronics","","","","","","23","","27 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a recent high-profile failure of an ASD project and the discontinued use of ASD in a software company have drawn attention to ASD's possible risks. Before we can manage such risks, we must identify them and understand why they arise. Researchers conducted interviews with 112 people in 28 organizations and with 25 ASD contractors and consultants.

Moreover, the lack of information early in the design can postpone decision-making further into the design cycle when it becomes more expensive and difficult to make changes. Differences across disciplines in their respective practices and lack of a common platform for exchanging information have contributed to this gap. In bridging this gap, an analytical decision support system is presented that enhances engineering design change management and knowledge management early in the design. The human factors involved in embracing such a system and adopting a structured knowledge management framework are investigated through a review of knowledge management theory, conducting a social network analysis, and analyzing the results of a survey of a west coast shipyard design team. To understand enablers and barriers to design change management and knowledge management, a system dynamics causal loop diagram is presented. The decision support system and design change - knowledge management framework presented in the current study is a viable option to bring multiple disciplines together on a common platform and to provide a method to enable informed decisions early in the design cycle.

Taking into account the intense competitiveness regarding sales and therefore production prices, shortening time to market and a broad technological diffusion of product technologies and components, efficiency in product development processes and consecutively production planning processes gains a major focus for innovating and disrupting companies. Due to a high level of maturity in early development stages, prototyping for mechatronic systems and especially electric drives offers an extensive but mostly unexploited source to gather information along these hardware processes that enables or supports production planning processes and increases their efficiency. Due to high costs for hardware experiments, a fixed location within development phase process models and missing theoretical and practical examination of this field, potentials are not exploited comprehensively.

This development method came into view to overcome the drawbacks of traditional development methods. Although agile development methods have become very popular since the introduction of the Agile Manifesto in 2001, however, there is an ongoing debate about the strengths and weakness of these methods in comparison with traditional ones. In this paper, a new dimension for the comparison between the two methods is presented. We postulate that, since both methods are based mainly on human activity, the two methods can be modeled using Chaos Theory. Source codes that are produced by the two methods in subsequent versions are characterized by a set of software metrics. Modeling and analysis of these metrics are performed using the Chaos Theory. Initial results show that the metrics sequences of both methods are chaotic sequences. Furthermore, agile methods produce more chaotic metrics sequences. However, is being chaotic a good or a bad feature? We argue that sometimes being chaotic is not a weakness, on the contrary, it is a strength.","","978-9-8975-8079-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292582","Agile Development;Waterfall Method;Software Metrics;Chaos Theory","Complexity theory;Correlation;Software;Measurement;Time series analysis;Mutual information","","","","","","29","","8 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our unique instructional technique had students work in both same-site and cross-site teams to contrast the two modes of working. The course was a collaboration between Aalto University, Finland and University of Victoria, Canada. Fifteen Canadian and eight Finnish students worked on a single large project, divided into four teams, working on interdependent user stories as negotiated with the industrial product owner located in Finland. Half way through the course, we changed the teams so each student worked in both a local and a distributed team. We studied student learning using a mixed-method approach including 14 post-course interviews, pre-course and Sprint questionnaires, observations, meeting recordings, and repository data from git and Flow dock, the primary communication tool. Our results show no significant differences between working in distributed vs. Non-distributed teams, suggesting that Scrum helps alleviate many GSE problems. Our post-course interviews and survey data allows us to explain this effect, we found that students over time learned to better self-select tasks with less inter-team dependencies, to communicate more, and to work better in teams.","1558-1225","978-1-4799-1934-5","10.1109/ICSE.2015.157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7202974","scrum;global software engineering;distributed scrum;teaching;project","Interviews;Teamwork;Software;Training;Planning","computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;software prototyping;teaching;team working","global agile software engineering learning;same-site teams;cross-site teams;GSE;distributed Scrum;instructional technique;Aalto University;Finland;University of Victoria;Canadian students;Finnish students;mixed-method approach;student learning;communication tool;interteam dependencies","","21","","28","","17 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main contribution is the learning lessons that may inspire other organizations to work with Scrum or Agile adoption. Once a strongly hierarchical organization has succeeded in its journey, why not others? The journey is still underway.

Project implementation is a complex process which requires simultaneous attention to a variety of factors - people, technology and processes. To determine whether a project is a success or a failure, one needs to know what are the important criteria of a project implementation in the eyes of the stakeholders. For this study, we are identifying the CSFs from a project manager's view. This study tries to identify which processes, people, tools and environment factors do experienced project managers regard as CSFs for IS projects implementation. Lessons learnt from these experienced project managers provide an important framework for establishing a sense of IS project implementation success, so that others can learn and take the necessary steps. This study is far from being exhaustive, but it can contribute to project managers by identifying and establishing the CSFs for IS project implementation, as there are not many studies concerning this being carried out for Malaysian Institution of Higher Learning (IHL).","","978-1-4244-7922-1","10.1109/ICT4M.2010.5971912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971912","Critical Success Factors;CSFs;IS;Information System Project Implementation;CMMI;Project Manager;Project Management;IHL;Malaysia","Lead;Industries","further education;information systems;project management","IS project implementation;higher learning;information system project managers;Malaysian Institution of Higher Learning","","5","","11","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The field of software agents is a broad and rapidly developing area of research, which encompasses a diverse range of topics and interests. Huge number of researches is going on by comparing the functional similarities of the Human Immune System for making the agents more adaptable with respect to security. An agent-based system was proposed by using functional commonalities of human Nervous system to adapt themselves to threats such as host attack. The agents become aware of the malicious hosts' attack by learning and coordination is maintained by a Co-Agent to make this system work successfully. The idea of learning and coordination are taken from the Human Nervous system functionality.

HL7 Version 2 (“v2”) health information exchange standards are a popular choice of local hospital communities for the exchange of healthcare information, including electronic medical record information. In development for 15 years, HL7 Version 3 (“v3”) was designed to be the successor to Version 2, addressing Version 2's shortcomings. HL7 v3 has been heavily criticized by the industry for being internally inconsistent even in it's own documentation, too complex and expensive to implement in real world systems and has been accused of contributing towards many failed and stalled systems implementations. HL7 is now experimenting with a new approach to the development of standards with FHIR.

The authors demonstrate the utility of the approach by implementing a solution to integrate the customer relationship Manager (CRM) and stock control system.","","978-1-4244-2020-9","10.1109/ICPCA.2008.4783558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4783558","Enterprise Resource Planning;Enterprise Application Integration;Service Oriented Architecture;Enterprise Systems","Enterprise resource planning;Service oriented architecture;Object oriented modeling;Application software;Collaboration;Supply chains;Customer relationship management;Globalization;Business communication;Humans","customer relationship management;enterprise resource planning;software architecture;stock control;supply chain management","novel architectural design model;enterprise systems;enterprise resource planning system;enterprise application integration;service oriented architecture;supply chain;customer relationship manager;stock control system","","1","","13","","13 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"PRINCE2 vs Scrum in digital business transformation","A. Ć. Hasibović; A.

There is no universal methodology, that could work for all projects, but digital transformation or Industry 4.0 indicates new management strategies, for which right framework is almost mandatory. Paper also emphasizes that digital transformation of an organisation can not be just an IT project. In case study we discuss budget, time and value for a project. We analyzed project of digital transforamation of insurance company, where we had case study of issuing a travel insurance policy. PRINCE 2 definitely provides wide range of guidelines that help managing project, but all the documentation demands certain knowledge, usually more time, and not lot of flexibility in project control. On the other side, Scrum does not provide enough documentation, and it' better for small projects, with fast delivery needs. Every methodology goal is efficiency and effectiveness, and we try to give guidelines which one to use, based on simple comparison.","2623-8764","978-953-233-098-4","10.23919/MIPRO.2019.8756716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756716","project;project management;PRINCE2;Scrum;digital transformation","","business data processing;insurance;project management","PRINCE2;Scrum;digital business transformation;project management methodologies PRINCE 2;universal methodology;digital transformation;management strategies;IT project;digital transforamation;project control","","2","","16","","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although, there has been consensus on an agile development process among the project partners, this approach stands in some contrast to the traditional (standardized or regulated) development processes commonly employed in the insurance domain, or general, in the public sector. The lessons learned of applying an agile requirements process under the conditions of traditional processes at the customer's site; geographically distributed offices of the customer and development team; diverse interests of involved customers' departments, administrative and operational staff; limited availability of field workers etc. are provided as recommendations for other research and development institutions. Thereby, the viewpoint of each project partner, including the customer's perspective, is described","2332-6441","978-0-7695-2555-6","10.1109/RE.2006.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704070","","","formal specification;formal verification;insurance data processing","occupational risks organization;agile requirements engineering;multidisciplinary software development project;employed requirements process;social insurance","","12","","13","","16 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
